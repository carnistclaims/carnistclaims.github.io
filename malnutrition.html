<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: A vegan family had a baby that suffered from malnutrition once</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim is intended to sow the seeds of doubt by claiming that some vegan family had a child that died of malnutrition, and therefore veganism is dangerous or somehow at least unhealthy.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. "Man bites dog"</h4>

<p>Uncommon events are given massive press coverage, particularly when they speak to narratives we construct in our heads, in order to generate clicks.  In the realm of <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubpdfs/fatality.pdf">1300 children</a> died of neglect each year - this is even before Covid.  How many of these stories do you see reported that are not trying to push some specific narrative?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Most of these stories have nothing to do with veganism</h4>

<p>Just from a quick search, <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/malnourished-baby-kept-on-vegan-diet-removed-from-italian-parents/ARVIJO3WQ5NVVR6IEG62ILGLOQ/?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11672246&amp;ref=NZH_FBpage">Here's a story</a> about a family that had a child which also had an untreated congenital heart condition.  So the parents have multiple forms of neglect, but veganism is, of course, blamed. <a href="https://www.oxygen.com/crime-news/ryan-sheila-oleary-charged-after-son-dies-of-malnutrition">Here's another story</a> about some people that fed their child a "raw-food plant-based" diet and the child died after they ignored multiple warning signs over an extended period of time. Just like if you just fed your infant blended lettuce, yes, that's technically also "a vegan diet", - let's blame veganism for your child's death!, The word "Vegan" is, of course, in the headline. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wjqbem/judge-convicts-parents-after-baby-dies-from-vegan-diet">Here's another story</a> from parents that had a child that died (in part) from dehydration after the parents saw a homeopathic doctor which helped them come to a conclusion that their child also needed to be gluten-free, then they fed the child no food, and he died - underweight, with an empty stomach. What word makes the headline? "Vegan".</p>

<p>The point is that those diets were as "vegan" as they were, say, "gluten-free" or "alfalfa free".  Is your survival now contingent on eating alfalfa at every meal because a child on an alfalfa-free diet died of neglect?  This position can't be taken seriously.</p>

<p>This is just journalistic malfeasance. The list goes on and on for half-baked reporters searching desperately for justification for their own carnismm, or trying to somehow cash in on some sort of anti-vegan sentiment. But this doesn't discredit veganism; this just shows carnists have no good arguments left and are throwing any old spaghetti at the wall hoping something sticks.  "Uh... uh... a vegan drummer I knew didn't keep tempo once! Therefore, vegans can't play music!" </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Carnism causes worldwide child malnutrition</h4>

<p>If you're so worried about the starving children, consider that your choice to eat animal products <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/jun/06/malnutrition-3-million-deaths-children">is a leading cause of child death by malnutrition worldwide</a>.  People with money and control in these countries export grain fed to livestock in order to satisfy the western demand.  So your choice to "save the children" by concern-trolling vegan diets is actually counterproductive.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. What's stopping <strong>you</strong> from going vegan?</h4>

<p>If you're reading this, <em>you're</em> not an infant.  Therefore, <em>you</em> don't need to worry about the implications of veganism for infants if <em>you</em> aren't one.  You can't possibly use that as a justification for killing animals for your own entertainment.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Verdict</h2>

<p>Stories about neglected "vegan" children just shows how weak the carnist position really is. </p>
