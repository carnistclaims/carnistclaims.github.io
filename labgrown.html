<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: "I'm just waiting for lab grown meat"</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>This line of nonsense is what honestly and sincerely made me make this entire website.  If I keep hearing people parrot this vacuous garbage unopposed I think I'm going to go nuts.</p>

<p>It's a meaningless aphorism designed to kick the can down the road.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Why</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Lab meat isn't a vegan product anyways</h4>

<p>So like it's a completely moot point to begin with.  It's engaged again in harm-reduction rather than elimination because it will still take animals to grow the stock.  Well, I guess I'm very glad that someone went from stealing 100 cars a year to 3, please outline for me how that is now ethical.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Carnists insist it'll magically be less expensive</h4>

<p>Labs are expensive.  How on earth is an already heavily subsidized industry where meat literally grows itself going to be outcompeted by a lab trying to grow a sample in bulk? So even best case scenario it'll be an indefinite "I'm waiting for lab meat to get cheaper" even when it does exist.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Still unsustainable</h4>

<p>This product has all the sustainability problems of meat, but now with the introduction of all the sustainability issues of bulk biomaterial synthesis.  I think meat eaters <strong>seriously</strong> underestimate the amount of animals killed each year. In the US alone, it's almost <a href="https://animalclock.org/">8,500,000,000</a> (yes, that's billion with a B)... <em>just in the United States</em>. Just in terms of cows alone, you're looking at some 100,000 cows' worth of meat grown daily. Animal metabolic processes are already otherworldly in efficiency compared to any biosynthetic process you can dream up. You'll never beat an animal thermodynamically at making meat. So you're not addressing the key energy constraints of this system anyways and it still will hurt other people to eat lab meat, perhaps even more.  </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. All meat isn't the same anyway</h4>

<p>People act like all the sudden one single lab-grown meat specimen is all it will take, like people aren't particular about what kind of steak they get.  As we all know: waygu, filet mignon, ribeye... it's all pretty much the same, right?  Especially when we talk about other animals like pork and chicken. This is again, more nonsense, and the deflection will continue even if one type of lab meat comes into existence.  "Oh I'm waiting for lab meat to be [more/less] [fatty/stringy/hard] and closer to the right [texture/flavor], etc."  The can-kicking will continue indefinitely.  "Sorry, it's just not the right <em>kind</em> of lab meat."</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. Non-meat products</h4>

<p>What about cheese? fish? eggs? etc. So ok, hang with me, instead of a vegan cheeseburger (that you can already buy)... the 'ethical' alternative is going to be an already non-vegan patty (which you will certainly pay more for with all the built-in sustainability issues) lined with... regular cheese? Very nice big-brain solution that accomplishes jack squat.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">6. Substitute for what?</h4>

<p>I'm fully convinced that no one actually believes this line when it comes out of their mouth (or keyboard) anyways. Like they really need a pure 100% 1:1 substitute for the meat patty on their crappy dollar-burger or for the slices of ham in their hot pocket? Give me a break. Seriously. As if the quality of meat on their frozen-puck bread-and-cheese burger is so gourmet that it needs to be grown in a lab and you can't give an inch even if it means slitting the throat of an innocent animal.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">7. There are already vegan alternatives for everything.</h4>

<p>I mean literally everything.  Burger patties, nuggets, wings, fish, cold cuts, sausage links, sausage patties, meatballs, etc. not to mention the non-meat animal products like butter, cheese (every kind - cheddar, provolone, mozzarella - you name it), milk, yogurt, whipped cream, egg whites, not to mention you can buy vegan cheesesteaks, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, sub sandwiches, corn dogs, hearty soups, pies, brownies, cookies, you name it. Literally everything. Some of these... get this... are better than the originals and more nutritious.</p>

<p>So what more do you want? It's just always not good enough</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">8. If you're not vegan by now, lab meat won't change that</h4>

<p>This line about lab-meat is just pure BS, designed to kick the can down the road and deflect responsibility.  "There's literally nothing I can do, lab meat doesn't exist!" Give me a break, if you parrot this line: quit waiting for other people to do things for you, grow a spine, and take moral accountability.</p>
