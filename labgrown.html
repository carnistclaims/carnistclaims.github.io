<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: "I'm just waiting for lab grown meat"</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>This line of nonsense is what honestly and sincerely made me make this entire website.  If I keep hearing people parrot this vacuous garbage unopposed I think I'm going to go nuts, because it's an infuriating combination of inauthentic self-congratulation and doing absolutely jack squat.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Why</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. There are already vegan alternatives for everything.</h4>

<p>I mean literally everything.  Burger patties, nuggets, wings, fish, cold cuts, sausage links, sausage patties, meatballs, etc. not to mention the non-meat animal products like butter, cheese (every kind - cheddar, provolone, mozzarella - you name it), milk, yogurt, whipped cream, egg whites, and even full foods like vegan cheesesteaks, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, sub sandwiches, corn dogs, hearty soups, pies, brownies, cookies, you name it. Literally everything.  Product after product comes out, and carnists don't care. Literally not even lifting a finger to stop torturing animals.  <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/impossible-burger-22903550">Even when the food is uncannily similar</a>.  I mean you really mean to tell me carnists really need a pure 100% 1:1 molecularly identical substitute for the slices of ham in their hot pocket, and even some imitation will subtract from just how gourmet that meal is? Give me a break. Seriously. It clearly isn't about taste, because people who eat tiny crappy dollar-menu meat-cheese-bread stacks don't care to stop torturing animals.  And it's not about nutrition, because vegan food <a href="expensive.html">is equal to or better on the nutrients</a>.  So it isn't that vegan food now is lacking something that lab meat solves.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. It's not even a solution</h4>

<p>Lab meat, which probably won't even be vegan anyways, has all the sustainability problems of meat, but now with the introduction of all the sustainability issues of bulk biomaterial multistep synthesis.  I think meat eaters <strong>seriously</strong> underestimate the amount of animals killed each year. In the US alone, it's almost <a href="https://animalclock.org/">8,500,000,000</a>. Just cows, you're looking at some 100,000 cows' worth of meat grown daily.  And labs are expensive.  How on earth is an already heavily subsidized industry where meat literally grows itself going to be outcompeted by a lab trying to synthesize a sample in bulk from a two (or more) stage sythnesis?  So it's going to be at best the same sustainability and ethical issues.  Again, lab meat literally solves nothing.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Carnists insist they'll magically switch</h4>

<p>And People also act like all the sudden one single lab-grown meat specimen is all it will take, like people aren't particular about what kind of steak they get.  As we all know: waygu, filet mignon, ribeye... it's all pretty much the same, right?  This is again, more nonsense, and the deflection will continue even if one type of lab meat comes into existence.  </p>

<p>"Oh I'm waiting for lab meat to come down in price, to be full-on cheaper than meat, [more/less] [fatty/stringy/hard] and closer to the right [texture/flavor], hit some arbitrary sustainability benchmark, to be accompanied by lab-grown cheese other lab-based animal products, etc."  The can-kicking will continue indefinitely.  I mean, people would rather eat extruded pig rectum than a vegan hot dog, or <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/food/how-safe-is-your-ground-beef">literal cow shit</a> than a pinto bean.  So why would anyone change when the first lab meat product hits market? Or the second? Or the fiftieth? </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. If you're not vegan by now, lab meat won't change that</h4>

<p>So lab meat solves zero problems, probably won't be eaten by carnists anyways, and is highly unlikely to appear in our lifetime or possibly ever as both 1. animal cruelty free and 2. cheaper than meat.  This whole line about lab-meat is just pure BS, designed to kick the can down the road and deflect responsibility.  "There's literally nothing I can do; lab meat doesn't exist!" </p>

<p>I mean it didn't occur to you to stop torturing animals when product A, B, and C came out.  Now, all of the sudden, you're on board with going 100% vegan and ending animal cruelty when some theoretical product Z comes out at some unspecified far-away future date (possibly never).  Why even lab meat? Why not "I'm going to go vegan when we colonize Enceladus"... or, hell, just tell the truth: "I'm only going to go vegan if and only if the cognitive dissonance becomes unbearable". </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. The part that kills me the most</h4>

<p>I'd be fine with leaving it at that, a curiousity that is probably not going to lead anywhere.  What kills me is that it's empty self-congratulation, learned helplessness, and empty do-goodery all at the same time. It's a ridiculous amount of of high-fiving at pseudo-futurologists 'discovering' some solution to a state that carnists pretend we're locked into, all the while pretending like they are being ethical because they are thinking about one day maybe doing the right thing (once the change requires zero effort on their part) and that gives them a warm blanket of absolution for sticking baby chicks into shredders alive today.  "This is why lab meat needs to be a thing yesterday". Why? Why would a product that solves none of these problems (a product that no one actually wants) need to be a 'thing'? </p>
