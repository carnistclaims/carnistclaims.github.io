<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Mulesing isn't supposed to hurt the sheep</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is about <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mulesing">"mulesing"</a>, in particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>it helps the sheep deal with insects</li>
<li>it is supposed to be done with anesthetic, and the fact that it isn't in most cases is just a vague argument for animal welfare that doesn't involve changing habits.</li>
<li>in some vague possible scenario someone has a pet sheep and they have the pet undergo this procedure to promote the animal's health, then it would be ethical</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It'll never be humane so long as the animals are slaughtered for meat</h4>

<p>That's all well and good that it's in theory supposed to be done under some set of conditions that are not harmful to the animals. But let's be honest: these animals are going to be slaughtered.  So as long as that happens, 1. Any such processes are simply part of the enablement of further abusing them and 2. Animals will be treated as commodities first and feeling beings second. These points will result in corners cut on procedures (like the anesthetic) which we would never want cut for, say, our pets, and it's still all well and good in the mind of the abusers, because these are just some dollar signs on four legs that are circling the drain until they have a bolt put through their heads. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Fantasy isn't reality</h4>

<p>One could in principle make an argument that they could have a pet sheep and gather wool from the pet just as a fun side project (equivalent to walking the dog or something) and maybe give that wool to friends or sell it or whatever.   But that isn't the question: right now, in actual reality, it's whether or not you want to enable that by dealing in these products which result in the abuse of the animals.  Regardless of what exists in some fantasy scenario, real animals are hurt when you purchase wool.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Verdict</h2>

<p>Mulesing hurts animals and is another reason buying wool is unethical.</p>
