<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: We need to find common ground</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here claims that 'finding some common ground' is necessary, and that vegans shouldn't be so militant, because that undermines veganism</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. "Here's how to spread a position I don't believe in"</h4>

<p>Carnists are imagining themselves to be world-class experts on spreading a position they themselves don't subscribe to. You haven't been convinced of the position, so why should I listen to you on what's most convincing?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. It means nothing</h4>

<p>100% of the time I have encountered this argument, it concretely means one of the following two things:\</p>

<ul>
<li>"I am against some low-hanging-fruit animal abuse X that I don't engage in, let's not focus on my own actions, let's just all be against X"</li>
<li>"Never talk about veganism ever, that's the best way to spread veganism"</li>
</ul>

<p>Actually the first point is being highly generous.  In a lot of cases, people say they're against factory farming, for instance, but eat McDonalds and buy frozen chicken wings by the gross - So it means literally nothing in that case.  At best it means 'I eat meat but am against horse racing - and all that veganism should be against is horse racing.  Don't be against meat eating or anything!'.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. It's concern trolling</h4>

<p>This is the classic line of "It hurts your cause to go after issue [thing that affects me] or to tell me I should [do something more than jack squat]; you would gain more support if you went after something I didn't participate in... or were gentler by recommending I made no changes. I just really want this whole project of ending animal cruelty to be a success and I'm concerned you're not going to be successful if you tell people to do anything different. That would be like... so sad. You don't want <em>more</em> animals hurt, do you??"  Miss me with that.</p>
