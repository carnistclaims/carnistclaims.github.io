<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Our [body part X] has developed for eating meat</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here claims that teeth or some other body part are evolved for eating meat, or that evolution is somehow prescriptive by some necessity.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. That means nothing</h4>

<p>Let me try this without getting too vulgar: Human females evolved to be able to have kids starting at age 12-ish. Go ahead and use your imagination as to what you can justify with that information and this argument.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. We don't live in the past</h4>

<p>What was ethical or necessary in the past isn't ethical or necessary now.  This argument just can't even be put forward as a decent argument if you think about it for any length of time.  If at one point it was necessary to do anything, that justifies nothing once that condition is no longer met.  Unless you think that the first killing in self-defense now justifies all murder once the self-defense is removed from the scenario. It really is a silly argument.  </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Evolution isn't prescriptive</h4>

<p>Some parasites evolved to eat their hosts from the least-to-most important parts so as to keep them alive for as long as possible and thereby inflict the maximum possible suffering.  That doesn't mean that this type of behavior is now prescribed as ethical.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Your brain is part of evolution</h4>

<p>Your brain evolved to make you know it's unethical to do so. So that's just as valid as any other body part.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. It doesn't actually address the argument</h4>

<p>You can't respond to the claim that "carnism hurts animals, other humans, the environment, and yourself" with "yeah, well we evolved to make it easier to do so".  That is a complete non-sequitur and does not counter the argument. Carnism remains unethical for those reasons, you've just mentioned an irrelevant fact.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Verdict</h2>

<p>The fact that you are evolved to be able to do something doesn't make it ethical.</p>
