<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: "Carnist" is just vegans trying to insult meat eaters</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>"Carnist isn't a word.  What even is this? Just some lame attempt at insulting meat eaters? Ha!"</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Trust me, if you think "Carnism" is an insult...</h4>

<p>Don't visit <a href="http://vegancirclejerk.reddit.com">/r/vegancirclejerk</a>, where the insults range from "omniscum" to "bloodmouth" to even more specific ones like "cheesebreather" for vegetarians. "Invertebrates" is a good one on account of a lack of a spine. The list goes on.  "Carnism" isn't intended as an insult, and if it were, wouldn't break the Top 20.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. What "Carnism" is intended to reflect</h4>

<p>It's a bit weird that, in any other context, we refer to the person perpetrating an immoral action by the positive demonym, and we usually lack one for those that abstain.  Is a non-rapist... a consensualist? What about a non-murderer? Or is a non-thief a... possessionalist? So why does the person that doesn't abuse animals get the name and those that do perpetuate immorality in this case not?  </p>

<p><em>N.B.</em> One might be tempted to use activists in this context but activism refers to active demonstration as opposed to refusal to participate - e.g. there's no term for non-slave-owner/non-slaver, even though all proper abolitionists are in this group, this isn't necessarily true the other way around - so it should not be confused. Again - non-slave-master, i.e. someone that doesn't participate in the immoral act of owning another person, isn't a demonym.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Veganism is the default</h4>

<p>Under any <a href="justified.html">reasonable moral system</a>, veganism is the default position.  So there's people that accept this default, i.e. "normal people", and there's carnists, which are the moral outliers.  </p>
