<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Animal Agriculture is not the largest contributor to climate change</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that one can add up other things to make an even greater total</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems with this Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's disingenuous</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/diet-fitness/vegan-eating-would-slash-cut-food-s-global-warming-emissions-n542886">Everyone going vegan</a> would cut climate emissions by 29%.  The counterargument that carnists put forth is that "Well, if you add up transportation of everything from humans themselves to textiles to sheet metal, you end up with a larger number".  First, <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/02/what-is-in-that-truck-i-just-passed-on-the-highway.html">animal agriculture makes up a significant portion of transportation</a>, including <a href="https://kanhaul.com/news/kan-hauls-food-transportation-infographic/">food imports, the majority of which are animal products</a>. But whatever, lets ignore all that.</p>

<p>Imagine this scenario: consider what it would mean if 29% of greenhouse gas emissions could be attributed to specifically 2-in-1 shampoo, and that you could lower your greenhouse gas emissions by 29% just using shampoo and conditioner separately?  Would it be fair to say "well, yeah but add up my driving, and that all together along with anything I've ever bought in a store ever (including my using clothes, computers, appliances, office supplies, etc.) and the movement of any product ever needed to deliver any service (from the metal that makes the cell towers to the wood that makes up my house). All of that added together makes up more greenhouse gas emissions than my 2-in-shampoo!  Owned!"</p>

<p>Obviously you can add up together the emissions of a bunch of products and services and give it a single label.  "Industry". "Transportation".  Those each are huge arrays of services and products you use.  "Agriculture" in any pie chart of emissions, to within a rounding error, represents only products involving the slaughter of animals.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">It's irrelevant?</h4>

<p>What if it was the number two cause of climate change, would that change the fact that you could cut your footprint by 29% by eliminating animal cruelty from your life by making very easy choices?  I mean, does that seriously change anything at all about the argument?</p>
