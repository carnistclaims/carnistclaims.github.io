<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: 'Locally sourced meat' is humane - as long as I avoid 'factory farming' I'm ok</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here claims that it's ok to eat food from non-factory farmed sources. Or 'humanely slaughtered' animals. Or whatever.  Also stated as "our animals have all good days and one bad day".</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems with this Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. "Of course Factory Farming is an abomination..."</h4>

<p>With all due respect, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPzDP-FEXBQ">Stefan Molyneux saying this</a> is worth about as much as "Thoughts and prayers for the animals RIP"... that and 25 cents buys you a newspaper.  It's totally devoid of any accountability. It's also the immediate go-to point reached for by <a href="https://youtu.be/PAOzGNFamgQ">Matt Dillahunty</a>... before he admitted that he ate meat at a restaurant the night before.  Any anytime sourcing is brought up, it's about antibiotics and meat quality, and I haven't heard a single carnist 'thinker' say that they avoid literally all meat they object to the source of on ethical grounds. So if you're anything like these 'public intellectuals' that have talked to vegans about veganism, you don't even believe this argument anyway.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. 'Humane' meat is a nonsense oxymoron</h4>

<p>Ok, Ted Bundy took in well-to-do attractive young girls and gave them 'one bad day'. Is that now ethical? What if you marry someone, provide for them, etc. and then give them the same 'one bad day' treatment? What if I did the same to a human child that I had cared for since birth? How is it humane, compassionate, or benevolent, to put a bolt through the head of an animal that does not want to die, purely for your 'one good day' of entertainment? It just isn't.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Collateral damage</h4>

<p>By killing animals, you're still hurting other people, starving people of needed food, and destroying the environment.  The 'good days' you gave that animal weren't so good for those you hurt along the way, either.</p>
