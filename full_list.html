            <h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="bred.html">AA100</a>: Animals are bred for agricultural use</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim is in various forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>it's ok to do X to animals because they are bred for purpose X.</li>
<li>it's ok to do X to animals because they are bred for purpose X, some other purpose Y, or some combination of the two.</li>
<li>they would not have been born if not for the motivation of the human towards purpose X.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. This probably isn't your actual justification</h4>

<p>Do you disagree morally with hunting? Do you ethically obstain from all meat that might be obtained from 'food' animals not bred for the purposes of food, like  hogs, or wild turkeys, or buffalo? If not, then you're just filibustering with random arguments, not presenting your actual justification.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. What about dogs?</h4>

<p>Humans have bred dogs for 1000s of years.  Does that make golden retriever steaks ok?  What about dogfighting? If breeding for purpose X is carte blanche for action X, you should know that most dogfighting dogs are bred for that exact purpose.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Bred for suffering?</h4>

<p>Selective breeding for traits like 'is made of more/tastier meat' doesn't actually change the amount of suffering an animal undergoes.  Frequently the opposite - most animals suffer greatly because their body proportions have been exaggerated.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Natalist fatalist?</h4>

<p>If you believe in the final form of the argument, then it should also be ok for two people to have a child explicitly for the purpose of torturing that child for their own entertainment.  In fact, that makes any claim of child abuse impossible for any intentional pregnancy. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. Collateral Damage</h4>

<p>This still doesn't address the damage done to the ecosystem, clearing land for breeding these animals, starvation of food from third-world countries to feed livestock. You are hurting plenty of non-bred animals when you eat cultivated meat for your own entertainment.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Related Claims</h2>

<ol>
<li><a href="cultivation.html">It's cultivation, not oppression</a></li>
</ol>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="cultivation.html">AA102</a>: It's cultivation, not oppression</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that animals are cultivated for use, not oppressed by animal agriculture</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems with this argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. This is semantics</h4>

<p>'Cultivation' just means that animals have been systematically exploited for a long time.  Having done something for a long time doesn't actually change the ethical characteristics of an action.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Breeding isn't justification</h4>

<p>Hence, <a href="bred.html">all of these arguments apply</a></p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="developed.html">AA200</a>: Our [body part X] has developed for eating meat</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here claims that teeth or some other body part are evolved for eating meat</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. That means nothing</h4>

<p>Let me try this without getting too vulgar: Humans evolved to be able to have kids starting at age 12-ish. Go ahead and use your imagination as to what you can justify with that information and this argument.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. We don't live in the past</h4>

<p>What was ethical or necessary in the past isn't ethical or necessary now.  This argument just can't even be put forward as a decent argument if you think about it for any length of time.  If at one point it was necessary to do anything, that justifies nothing.  Unless you think that the first killing in self-defense now justifies all murder. It really is a silly argument.  </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Evolution isn't prescriptive</h4>

<p>Some parasites evolved to eat their hosts from the least-to-most important parts so as to keep them alive for as long as possible and thereby inflict the maximum possible suffering.  That doesn't mean that this type of behavior is now prescribed as ethical.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Your brain</h4>

<p>Your brain evolved to make you know it's unethical to do so. So that's just as valid as any other body part.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. It doesn't actually address the argument</h4>

<p>You can't respond to the claim that 'carnism hurts animals, other humans, the environment, and yourself' with 'yeah, well we evolved to make it easier to do so'.  That is a complete non-sequitur and does not counter the argument. Carnism remains unethical for those reasons, you've just mentioned an irrelevant fact.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="teeth.html">AA201</a>: We have canines to eat meat</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea here is that eating meat is ok because we have developed omnivorous canines to do so</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Yeah... no you do not.</h4>

<p>You really think your canines look like an omnivore's?  Since bears are such a frequent point of comparison for an omnivorous diet, go ahead and quickly <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bear+growling&amp;t=ffab&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">look up bear teeth</a>.  Now look in the mirror.  Ok, so that wasn't even close.  Do the same with racoons.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Teeth don't prescribe diet</h4>

<p>You can look at <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=saber+tooth+deer&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">the sabre-tooth deer</a> for guidance there if you like.  Or <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=gorilla+screaming&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">gorillas</a> (yes, they are herbivores) if you like. This argument falls apart immediately if literally take 10 seconds to look up any animals ever.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Evolution is a bad argument in general</h4>

<p><a href="developed.html">For all of these reasons</a>.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="intelligence.html">AA202</a>: Eating Meat helped us evolve higher intelligence</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea is that eating meat helped us in the past evolutionarily, so it is justified today.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. You're not surviving off the land on the Serengeti</h4>

<p>You can't talk about hunting animals with spears having helped us evolve to justify putting frozen bags of chicken wings in their shopping cart.  Freezers didn't exist; shopping carts didn't exist.  Furthermore, the animals you're killing now aren't the ones you would have killed back then. So, you've modified the entire narrative except for the part that's the most convenient for you. You want to pay money, which didn't exist, to have someone truck your meat in from a factory farm. None of this has anything to do with the original action in reality.  This is just nonsense.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. We don't live in the past</h4>

<p>What was ethical then isn't now. Xenophobia and tribal warefare, for instance, was a major player in keeping tribes together and affected human migration patterns that had us populate the globe, but does that give us freedom to do whatever we want to people that look different from ourselves? Of course not.  If we simply give <em>carte blanche</em> to anything which helps propage the human race, then that would by necessity include rape.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. It doesn't actually address the argument</h4>

<p>You can't respond to the claim that 'it hurts animals, other humans, the environment, and yourself when you consume animal products for your own entertainment' with 'yeah, well it helped us evolve'.  That is a complete non-sequitur and does not counter the argument. Carnism remains unethical for those reasons, and you've just mentioned an irrelevant fact.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="thousands.html">AA300</a>: We have been eating meat for thousands of years</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist claims that eating meat is somehow to be grandfathered in as though it is now ethical, simply because it was necessary in the past.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It wasn't necessary in the past</h4>

<p>The idea that it was necessary is a baseless assertion. But let's assume that it indeed was.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Times change</h4>

<p>Do you walk everywhere you need to go or take a draft animal?  No, you get in a car or bus, which is like the old thing you used to do... but it has been changed and modernized. It's interesting how the only thing we hold on tightly to is the easiest thing to do.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. You can justify literally anything like this</h4>

<p>People have been doing a lot of things for a long time, including slavery, murder, theft and torture. After all, you had to kill that other guy before he potentially killed you, just like you needed to kill that animal before you potentially ran out of food.</p>

<p>It wasn't ethical then and it definitely isn't now.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="foodchain.html">AH100</a>: Humans are the top of the food chain</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>Carnists claim that humans are justified in eating meat because it is their natural place within ecology to do so</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. The food chain isn't real</h4>

<p>The concept of a food chain is an invention that helps schoolchildren understand basic ecology.  It is too simplified to even be useful in biology, such as in cases where two species (usually one being invasive) predate on each other or on each others' young, for instance, or when species eat their own young.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. This isn't your actual justification anyways</h4>

<p>Even if the food chain really existed as a real thing, is drinking other species' milk really apex-predator behavior?  Or putting a stack of neatly extruded pepperoni into a shopping cart? So, some imagined 'food chain' isn't actually why you do what you do.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. It's not even justification</h4>

<p>Even if you accept the argument that humans are part of some imagined natural ecology that somehow includes hotdogs, it does not follow that what is natural within ecology is automatically ethically justified.  Is eating the young of your own species ok because animals do it in the wild?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Self-defeating</h4>

<p>Even if you somehow ignore all these problems, meat is still an ecological disaster that also starves people in third-world countries, which serves to only destroy the very 'food chain' you're arguing for. So you can't use really use that as justification for eating meat or consuming animal products.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="lions.html">AH101</a>: Lions eat meat</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist claims that because some species eat meat, we should ethically be allowed to</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. You are not an obligate carnivore</h4>

<p>The point is that if you're reading this, you don't need to eat meat to live.  So this isn't a question of what an animal that has no choice would do; you do have a choice! So you can't point to someone else's self defense, for instance, to justify outright murder.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. It's cherry picking.</h4>

<p>Interesting that you conveniently pick the lion.  Let's pick an animal arguably much more similar to you, monkeys that throw their feces in an argument.  Are you also going to copy that or claim that is ethical behavior? (If you happen to disagree and see me in real life... please don't)</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. That doesn't address the ethical consequences</h4>

<p>Carnism hurts animals, other people, the environment, and yourself.  Your justification can't be "yeah, well he's doing it too".  Ok great, now because Ted Bundy exists murder is ethical? Carnism remains unethical for those reasons, and you've stated a tangentially related fact. </p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="godput.html">AH200</a>: God put animals here to eat</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist claims some theological superiority on the basis of theology</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. The Bible is "The Big Book of Multiple Choice"</h4>

<p>As Jeff Dee pointed out in coining that phrase, you can cherry pick verses that go either way on a lot of things.  Just simply look at any list of biblical contradictions.  Not necessarily am I saying that they are all clear contradictions, but rather that post-hoc rationalizations can be used to justify any position one way or the other. Is "God is love; love is never jealous" or is it that "God's name is 'Jealous'"?  Sure, you can argue that one is saying X and the other Y, but can you argue in good faith that this is the <strong>only</strong> reasonable interpretation that could ever be possible for this combination of verses?  Of course not. Hence why slavers and abolitionists in the United States were both quoting from the same book.  Other holy books are usually no better in this regard.</p>

<p>So, no suprise, you can support - from Holy books - everything from human slavery to female genital multilation. So unless you're willing to accept that any religously motivated action is now free game, then this isn't a good argument. Particularly when you might get stoned to death.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. You can use bible verses to support veganism.</h4>

<p>There are many Christians and Jews who believe strongly in their religious conviction towards avoiding animal suffering. For instance, in the Garden of Eden, when things were good, in Genesis 1:29, Isaiah 11:6-8 and so on.  This isn't about a theological debate though, just recognize that if you <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=bible+supports+veganism">search for the bible supporting veganism</a> you'll get a lot of hits.  Perhaps if you're a Christian, you might be best convinced by simply by <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>. Ask yourself what you think the law on your heart is.  Does that include imprisoning and torturing animals for your own entertainment? If not, then you are without excuse.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Religious Institutions routinely apologize</h4>

<p>The catholic church issued a list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_apologies_made_by_Pope_John_Paul_II">nearly 100 apologies</a> that were the result of religiously motivated action. Even if your sect claims religious exemption for eating meat, can you assert that eating meat will <em>never</em> be on such a list that includes slave trade and injustice towards women?</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="animals.html">AH201</a>: Animals are made to be eaten</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>If animals aren't meant to be eaten why are they made of food?</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. This is a thing people say but don't believe</h4>

<p>Humans are also technically made of food. Is involuntary cannibalism now moral? No.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Might makes right</h4>

<p>This is ultimately a might-makes-right argument. We can eat animals so we should.  Well can and should are two different things and the fact that you can do something doesn't logically follow to the fact that it is ethical to do so</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. It still hurts other people</h4>

<p>People in other countries are starved for first-world meat, and there are heavy environmental impacts. This argument doesn't actually address those problems which would make it unethical anyways, regardless of the point of view of the animal</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="understand.html">AM100</a>: Animals don't understand morality</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claims are variously stated:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you look out in nature, animals kill each other and have no moral qualm about it, so why should we?</li>
<li>Animals don't understand morality, and therefore we have no moral obligation towards them</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Moral agency isn't a requirement for being the subject of moral obligations</h4>

<p>If it were, then we would say that we have no moral obligation towards the mentally disabled or small children.  Clearly we do.  This isn't about the animal's moral obligations towards us; it's about our moral obligation towards the animals.  Obviously, we can't hold a shark 'accountable' for biting a human, but we should definitely hold a human accountable for killing sharks needlessly by the thousands.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. We don't use someone else's ethics in determining our own actions</h4>

<p>A toddler will walk up to other kids and randomly take things from their hands, because they don't understand social norms. Ok cool, so any time a toddler is holding something, it's fair game for me to take! Wait... that doesn't morally follow. Am I allowed to assault the mentally handicapped or people with dementia because they might hit me? No, of course not. So, given that we never use someone else's morality for our own, why do we justify it in this one particular instance?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Most 'food' animals don't kill other animals</h4>

<p>Most animals we eat are typically prey animals and not predators. All the classic farm animals are herbivores, as well as deer, quail, and almost all other commonly hunted animals. The fact that an obligate-carnivore predator kills prey 'without regard' (whatever that means - did we survey lions or something?) doesn't really apply to you also killing the prey. If anything, shouldn't it be the opposite - I mean, do you regularly envision yourself jumping in when you see someone kicking the crap out of a frail person to help the assailant?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Most 'natural conditions' are obligate carnivorous conditions</h4>

<p>If you are reading this, you are not an obligate carnivore, and therefore the actions of an animal that does something out of necessity (or an omnivorous animal who doesn't know where its next meal is coming from) doesn't apply to you doing something unnecessary with your grocery pickup where neat packages of ground beef are placed in the trunk of your car at the click of a button. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. People understand Morality</h4>

<p>...and eating meat hurts other people, for instance, in countries where food scarce due to it being exported to feed 'food' animals, or in the form of climate change. So that can't be your justification.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="reciprocal.html">AM200</a>: Carnivores would kill you if given the chance</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that lions, etc. would kill you so it is ok to kill them.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Most of the time you're not killing predators</h4>

<p>Most animals you eat are herbivores, such as cows, pigs, sheep, chickens, etc.  So you're not actually applying the morality of the animals you claim towards what I would wager is 100% of the animals you kill or eat. So the supposed morality of carnivores doesn't even apply.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. We don't dictate our morality based on our enemies</h4>

<p>If a six-year old is mad at you and punches your leg, are you allowed to lay him out with a kick to the throat? Of course not. So why is it that you're allowed to use your larger might in this case to use weapons on animals, even if they don't have the same moral compass?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Carnists don't follow this when it comes to other animals</h4>

<p>Most carnists would agree that you don't bite other people's cats, or bark at other people's dogs, even if they would do the same to you.  So carnists don't actually believe this argument with regards to themselves</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. The other vicims</h4>

<p>Eating meat comes with other impacts such as the starvation of food out of countries to feed livestock, as well as environmental impacts that hurt people. So this doesn't justify the collateral damage that comes with animal agriculture.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Related Claims</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="understand.html">Animals don't understand morality</a></li>
</ul>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="milk.html">EA100</a>: Milk production is not harmful to farmed animals</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The cow on the carton is smiling.  I mean, so how could it be unethical with drinking milk today from a grocery store?</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's fiction</h4>

<p>Carnists imagine a smiling cow on a hill with a giant bell around its neck where a blonde girl with two braids and a blue apron comes up the hill with a bucket to milk the cow under a rainbow. Eliminate this image from your mind.  It has nothing to do with reality.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. The nasty reality</h4>

<p>Actual milk production starts with forceful artifical insemination, involves a guy with a hand gloved up to his shoulder and the rest leaves little to the imagination.  The cow gives birth and the calf is seperated from the mother to avoid cutting into the yield too much, and is either sold off to be slaughtered within a few months of being alive, or... if it's a female in good condition it can be raised to perpetuate the cycle.  The cow will continue this cycle, and will probably be killed before its sixth birthday, well before its life expectancy of 20 years.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. The results</h4>

<p>Given that the production of milk is inherently tied to the slaughter of animals, vegans argue (correctly) that lactovegetarianism represents 0% middle ground between slaughtering animals and not.  By drinking milk you are still subsidizing the slaughter of animals, and <a href="milkfarm.html">it doesn't matter if it's a 'local farm'</a>, either, so all of those arguments apply.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Collateral Damage</h4>

<p>You still are paying for cows to take food from developing countries, you're still contributing to the unsustainability of the animal agriculture industry, and doing a lot of ecological damage.  Taking the milk and not the meat doesn't actually solve any of those issues, either.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="milkfarm.html">EA101</a>: Animal Products are ok if it's local</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>"My uncle's farm has a bunch of cows that are kept in good conditions as pets, so its ethical to drink their milk?  Or is it ok to eat their eggs?"  (The same arguments apply either way)</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Where are all the males?</h4>

<p>Ok, so your uncle bought a female calf and hens from some place, who sold a bunch of female calves and hens to other people... where did the males go, again?  Probably the same place Betsy the Cow will go after she no longer makes milk and is 'getting older now' at a third her natural lifespan.  "Oh we sold her and she's living on a happy farm on the other side of town. Yep! Someone with a business paid us money and is definitely doing that. That's definitely where those cows all are now."  That's sarcasm, for the uninformed. They got a bolt through the head and were hung upside down and had their throats slit open. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. You're still contributing to that economy</h4>

<p>You're still paying money for an animal product and thereby you're still propagating money and tacit approval within that system to strengthen the economy of animal abuse.  For instance, other people would take that milk in lieu of milk they get from even more destructive sources. You are still paying for your uncle to contribute to animal slaughter, and even if he gives you milk and eggs for free, your uncle is still deriving personal value from those animal products in the form of a gift to you and is therefore more likely to continue paying for animals and therefore their abuse and slaughter.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Sustainability issues remain</h4>

<p>Not only are you still paying for slaughtering of animals, this doesn't address the sustainability issues around animal agriculture, because you still are feeding livestock animals food that causes global starvation and deforestation, using massive amounts of water, and causing ecological harm.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. It doesn't help</h4>

<p>All <a href="local.html">'my food is locally-sourced' argument issues</a> remain.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. For milk, specifically: Cows only produce milk when pregnant</h4>

<p>So your uncle is still selling off calves for slaughtering to keep up the milk production in any sort of volume.  If he's artificially inseminating them, it is also bestiality. So the animal abuse and cruelty continues with every pregnancy to keep the milk supply going.</p>

<p>The year is 2505.  Everyone is vegan.  We have a sanctuary with some cows that aren't forcibly interacted with.  What's wrong with milking one and selling the milk?</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Cows only produce milk when pregnant</h4>

<p>So without artificial insemination, you're relying on the natural reproductive cycle of cows to determine when to drink their milk, which the calf is cutting into, and the cow only is producing significant milk for a relatively short period of its life, maybe a quarter - if you're lucky.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Help me out here</h4>

<p>Ok, so here's the plan, you now need to keep cows for at least 4 times their current lifespan well past when they make milk, you have at least twice as many animals (males are now not automatically slaughtered).  So you're looking at at least an order of magnitude reduction in the amount of milk right off the bat.  If you're looking at grass-fed only and you're not artifically inseminating the cows to produce the milk (because you've somehow reasoned yourself out of beastiality), it's even worse on the sustainability. And with no slaughter market to keep such milk profitable, there will be orders of magnitude less animals (for reference, there are about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_bison">30000 total American Bison</a> alive today, which is how many cows are slaughtered in America <a href="https://animalclock.org/">on average every 8 hours</a>).  </p>

<p>So lets do this calculation, shall we? Let's just talk US, and I'd be generous and assume 100000 cows, but I'll even be generous and give another order of magnitude.  A million cows. So at let's say even half their lifespan to 10 years to be more generous (so that's 100000 pregnancies per year). And with all this generousity you're looking at a cow pregnancy rate (and therefore milk production rate) of slightly less than 0.3% our current rate, assuming we avoid practices like mother-calf separation or forced milking, etc. which could each reduce the production by an order of magnitude each but we'll ignore because, again, I'm just so generous.</p>

<p>So let me get this straight, your big-brain plan is to avoid going 100% vegan by going 99.7% vegan on milk, and 100% vegan on everything else. Okay. Great job. Well done. That's all with the heaviest lowball of all time on that percentage.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. This is a fantasy anyway</h4>

<p>We're now pretty deep into fantasy land here; this alternate universe has nothing to do with reality. You can't use this as any sort of justification for using animal products in the real world, where it involves the <a href="milk.html">active torture and slaughter of animals</a>.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="eggs.html">EA200</a>: Egg production is not harmful to farmed animals</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here claims that egg production is not harmful so eating eggs is not unethical</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Unethical farm practices are abound</h4>

<p>Baby chicks are thrown into shredders alive as a part of egg production.  Males as well as females with issues are simply tossed into a mascerator.  Interestingly, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-ban-chick-shredding-from-2022-in-global-first/a-56285846">Germany is taking a bold stance</a> to be the first western country to phase this out legally by 2022.</p>

<p>Otherwise factory farmed chickens have their beaks removed, live in confined spaces standing generally in their own feces, and are mercifully not required to live under such horrific conditions their whole natural decade-or-longer lifespans as they are killed <a href="https://www.four-paws.us/campaigns-topics/topics/farm-animals/life-expectancy">before their second birthday</a>, usually.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. You're subsidizing chicken meat</h4>

<p>You're making it more economical to turn chickens into corpses, and therefore you are participating financially in incentivizing meat production, and all the sustainability and human costs associated with it.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Locally sourcing doesn't help these issues</h4>

<p><a href="milkfarm.html">You might think so but it does not</a></p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="wool.html">EA300</a>: Sheep enjoy being sheared</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist claim here is that sheep don't get hurt in shearing so it can't be unethical</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. That's actually not true</h4>

<p>Go ahead and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mulesing">look up "mulesing"</a>, I'll wait. Again, carnists have this idea that it's a cute sheep on a sunny field and it enjoys being sheared.  This is a fantasy.  Sheep are part of animal agriculture, they are in factory farms with the rest of the animals living in confined squalor, and are routinely scratched by automated shears, and are abused and terrorized.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Until they are killed for meat</h4>

<p>Oh yeah, there's that.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. You're still funding animal agriculture</h4>

<p>You're still paying money for animal agriculture, and you're still funding the torture of animals. You are increasing the profitability of taking a sheep and turning it into meat.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="superior.html">EH100</a>: Humans are superior to animals</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here claims that killing animals is ok because humans are not equal to animals</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Almost no vegans believe that anyway</h4>

<p>Almost no vegan believes that a human life is equal to an animal one (I'm sure you'll find some strange exceptions).  In fact, I think it's totally reasonable to think some human lives are more valuable than others.  If you have kids, you might easily find yourself believing in a moment of choice that your child's life is more valuable than your own, or more valuable than that of an elderly, frail, or terminally ill person.  The idea that all lives must be equal to believe in veganism is a strawman argument.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Equality to humans isn't the criterion</h4>

<p>It's about whether or not the worth of an animal life is equal to the worth of a human life; it's about whether the worth of an animal's life is greater than the worth of your entertainment of eating meat.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="intelligent.html">EH101</a>: I base my morality on intelligence</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here claims that animals are less intelligent than humans and therefore can be slaughtered for food.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. We don't base morality on intelligence in any other context</h4>

<p>We don't regard the mentally disabled or children with any less regard than that of an intelligent adult - in fact, we generally do exactly the opposite, our natural instinct is to defend the defenseless in any other context.  We also don't consider that a more intelligent adult should be issued hunting licenses for less intelligent adults. So this argument doesn't hold water.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Carnists don't even believe their own argument</h4>

<p>Do we just draw a line at doing math, <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/animals-can-do-almost-math">not just any math</a>, because we'll still eat them, but I mean symbolic math? And also, cavemen didn't regularly do symbolic math, and we wouldn't eat them... so the plan is we have to take <a href="species.html">a species</a>, sit them down, try to teach them symbolic math, and if they fail, we eat them. Right?  But not dogs; we decided you can't eat a golden retriever for some reason.  Also pigs are generally regarded as smarter than cats, and we don't eat cats. So even on a species-by-species basis (which itself is <a href="species.html">untenable</a>) what's the real metric? Carnists never talk about this in concrete terms they just vaguely gesture at 'more intelligent'.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. There is no objective measure of intelligence anyways</h4>

<p>Consider we travel to another planet and meet a bunch of beings not unlike ourselves.  They are better than us at calculus, but worse at emotional intelligence so they couldn't cooperate to build a spaceship - that meant we visited them first, rather than vice-versa. Who gets to eat whom? Or is emotional intelligence not 'real intelligence' as declared by whom?  </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Collateral Human Damage</h4>

<p>By eating meat you're hurting other people in addition to animals, so you aren't addressing that issue, which doesn't satisfy your own criteria</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="species.html">EH102</a>: I base my morality on a species-by-species basis</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here claims that variously:
- moral arguments should be made by species
- moral arguments are granted by species because members of a species can breed to make more of that species</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Species isn't even a single thing</h4>

<p>This argument by Stefan Molyneux was presented in terms of animals that give birth to other animals.  Well sorry to say, but all animals have a common ancestor, so by Molyneux's own definition he should be a vegan.  The problem with using 'species' is that boundaries on species are fuzzy, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species">ring species</a> a single 'species' by this definition?  So this is already a problematic and fuzzy area, and if you think that fuzzy boundaries are no problem, remember we're talking about a dividing line as harsh as 'you go to jail for killing species X' and 'you go to jail for stopping someone from killing species Y'. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Species is an arbitrary classification</h4>

<p>You choose species. Cool, I choose skin color... or race... or gender.  Wait, what makes species a better dividing line? Every single answer ever given has been name-the-trait can-kicking at best. E.g. "Oh, it's because X", wherein X is simply part of the arbitrary definition of species.  It never actually gets clarified.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Carnists don't even believe their own argument</h4>

<p>Ask a carnist if they'd eat a golden retriever and they say no.  But coyote hunting is a thing, and most carnists won't object to it, even though coyotes, wolves, and dogs are all the same species and can interbreed with each other. And there are plenty of cases where carnists don't grant different members of our own species the same rights. So their own argument isn't even followed or truly believed by carnists anyway.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Morality by class</h4>

<p>Why should the morality of individual A towards individual X be dictated by the existence or characteristics of individual Y or W that are not part of this transaction? Is there any other (less morally convenient) example wherein that's the case (ignoring emergent properties - we're not talking about you are part of species X and therefore have characteristic Y, and the real criterion is characteristic Y - we're talking about being a part of species X itself being a criterion for morality)? E.g. why is the morality of whether or not I get to kill you based on whether or not there are a bunch of other things that look like you around such that I bunch you all in together and give you all the same (inferior to my own) rights? It's a nonsensical argument.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. Collateral damage</h4>

<p>This argument still doesn't take into account the ecological and human impact of eating meat, and it remains unethical for those reasons as well.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="subjective.html">EH200</a>: Morality is subjective anyways</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that was can axiomatially define morality to include carnism </p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's not morality then</h4>

<p>Call it schmorality, or whatever you want.  But unless it focuses on the reduction of needless harm towards the wellbeing of conscious beings, it can't be morality.  So I can axiomatically define moral as 'giving the author of carnist.cc free money' and the opposite immoral, but is that really actually morality?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. You really pretzel up</h4>

<p>If you want your morality to be internally consistent, you have to take into account the human impact of eating animals. So now it starts to become ok and not ok to do highly arbitrary combinations of things. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Just admit it already</h4>

<p>You're inflicting needless suffering and reducing the wellbeing of conscious creatures for your own entertainment when you eat meat. There's not a good justification for this in any reasonable moral system.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Related Claims</h2>

</ul>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="necessity.html">EH300</a>: "What if you had to kill an animal out of necessity to feed your family?!"</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>Millenial Millie presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScbeMdYkKDc">more or less this argument</a> to Earthling Ed as justification for animal agriculture. This has various forms.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. That doesn't apply here</h4>

<p>This has literally nothing to do with the optional killing of animals for your own entertainment. Have you ever been in a situation in your life where you have had to kill and eat an animal and feed to it a love one or else you would starve.  Let me answer that for you, no you have not. So let's get back to reality.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Stupid arguments deserve stupid answers</h4>

<p>The funniest answer is just "Why would I kill an animal when I can pick up a vegan pizza from a place 5 minutes from my house".  "Ok but I mean what if you were on a desert island?".  "Oh then I would wait until the director yelled 'cut' and we were done filming <em>then</em> order them something to eat from my phone.". "No I mean you're not acting in a movie." "Oh am I then in a TV show?... because there's a lot of vegan joints in southern California...". And just disingenuously head for the door in any thought experiment.  They put you on a glacier with only a seal to eat? Screw it, you put aliens in a flying saucer there with you. </p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="desert.html">EH301</a>: If you were put on a desert island with a pig and he was all you could eat, then you would</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>No, that's really the argument for buying meat from a grocery store.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Oh, ok, if you get to give me a scenario, then I get to give you one</h4>

<p>To honestly answer: I don't know. I'm assuming that I wouldn't know if rescue was coming. I assume that, if literally no other food sources exist, I realistically would probably wait for the pig to die and then eat his corpse but I suppose that depends on the demeanor of the pig and self-defense.  Whoever lives longer wins I guess, but I also have never gone any length of time without any food options (even if I was rejecting them to fast) - so I really don't know what day ten of hunger-induced delerium and marooned boredom looks like.  I consider the likelihood of such a scenario ever happening to be essentially 0%.</p>

<p>My turn! It's tomorrow (or some other time in the next few days) and you're hungry. You're considering eating [food X] that has egg in it.  But you remember this fact: that baby chicks are routinely thrown into shredders alive as part of the egg industry.  What do you do? Do you pay money to create demand for this practice or not? I consider the likelihood of such a scenario, if you regularly eat eggs, to be essentially 100%.  If you don't substitute in your favorite animal product and factory farming technique.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Arguments of necessity don't matter when it's unnecessary</h4>

<p>What you would do on a desert island has nothing to do with <a href="necessity.html">reality</a>.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="products.html">EH400</a>: it's legal to eat animal products</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The objection is that it's legal so therefore moral</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Literally no one believes this argument when they make it</h4>

<p>Is female genital mutilation moral in countries where it is legal?  Dogfighting?  Slavery at one point in the US?  This can't be a thought thought by a critcally thinking person.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="ingredient.html">EH500</a>: X isn't an essential ingredient of chicken, egg, cow, etc. products</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist claims that since X isn't a necessary ingredient to making product Y it isn't a moral consideration.  E.g. Shredding baby chicks alive isn't a necessary component of making eggs, and therefore the fact that chicks are shredded is not of moral consideration when buying eggs.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It doesn't matter</h4>

<p>It literally does not matter that stealing a car isn't a necessary component to driving a car, stealing a car is wrong.  We don't judge an action based on whether or not it <em>could</em> be moral, so that can't be your defense if you're driving a car you stole.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="pooling.html">EH501</a>: I'm not paying for it, it's just collateral damage</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>This argument is a claim that carnists don't actually pay for chicks to be thrown into a shredder, they are just paying someone for eggs and the fact that they are being thrown into a shredder is just a thing that happens. Another form of the same argument is "I'm not paying for baby chicks to be shredded, the farmer is".</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's not better</h4>

<p>We've established that if you're doing something immoral, it's immoral to <a href="payment.html">pay to have it done</a>. Well the same argument applies here, just simply one more step.  If it's immoral to pay to have something done, it's also immoral to pay someone to pay someone to have something done.  The fact that you go through an additional middleman doesn't justify the action all of the sudden.  This attempt to move things one more level out is just skirting responsibility. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. This argument doesn't work anywhere else</h4>

<p>It's unethical to murder someone.  It's unethical to pay a hitman to murder someone.  How does it suddenly become justified if we and some other would-be murderers get together, pool our money, and hire a few hitmen to kill a few people? Does that absolve the crime? Of course not.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="humanrights.html">EH600</a>: I am only concerned with human rights</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea here is that the only individuals that deserve rights are humans.  The other way this is stated is to simply deny that it is an ethical issue altogether.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Almost no carnists actually believe this</h4>

<p>We grant plenty of animals rights. Dogs have a right to not be forced into dogfighting.  Unless a carnist is willing to step forward and say that they are </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Animal agriculture hurts people</h4>

<p>It destroys ecologies surrounding factory farms, leads to global warming, starves poorer countries of their food, while forcing non-participants to pay for it with animal agriculture subsidies (read: theft), amongst other issues. So yes, it hurts people.  You should be concerned with such human rights.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="justified.html">EH601</a>: I don't need to justify carnism; you need to justify veganism</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea is that carnism is some sort of default position, and that hurting animals doesn't require justification.  <em>Au contraire</em> vegans need to justify veganism.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Great!</h4>

<p>Here's the justification: Carnism hurts you, hurts the environment, hurts other people, and hurts animals. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Carnists don't believe this with regards to their favorite animals</h4>

<p>Everyone gets up in arms about hurting dogs, cats, and horses. So when it comes to dogfighting, that's all well and good.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. I can make the same argument about humans of a different race</h4>

<p>And we're <a href="species.html">back here</a>.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="hunting.html">EN100</a>: I hunt animals as an act of mercy when they would die in the wild anyway</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that hunted meat is ethical because:
- it would be ethical for everyone to only eat meat from hunted animals and abolish animal agriculture.
- hunting is an act of mercy and that killing an animal is therefore a good thing
- carnists are controlling the overpopulation 
- the animal dies instantly rather than letting it starve out from overpopulation</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. No one making this arguments believes it</h4>

<p>I have met zero people that hunt and otherwise eat completely vegan at restaurants, friends' houses, etc. on ethical grounds. That person just doesn't exist.  If that's you, congrats, you get to read on... but if it's not, then close this page and make a different bad argument against veganism.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. It's not sustainable for everyone to eat like this</h4>

<p>The number of deer hunted in the <a href="https://business.realtree.com/business-blog/america%E2%80%99s-deer-harvest-numbers">US is about 6 million</a>, which makes 336M lbs of meat, or just about 1 lb per person (This is much larger than other animals like elk for instance, which is about <a href="https://www.backcountrychronicles.com/elk-harvest-comparison-western-states/">6M lbs of meat</a> by my calculation - assuming 400lbs meat/elk - in states when it's common). In the same time, <a href="https://farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/2021/05/an-overview-of-meat-consumption-in-the-united-states.html">The US consumed about 265 lbs/person of meat</a>. So if everyone just relied on deer hunting, we're looking at a 99.5% reduction in meat consumption in the US by these numbers. So <a href="milkvegan.html">again</a>, the big-brain plan that carnists propose so they don't need to go 100% vegan is to go 99.5% vegan on meat (and 100% on other animal products).  Great plan. 5D chess over here.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Killing things instantly doesn't make killing ethical</h4>

<p>Can I kill a person instantly and it be ethical? No? Ok, so why does that work for animals? "They're a different species" <a href="species.html">doesn't work</a>, <a href="intelligent.html">Intelligence</a> doesn't work. Whatever other answer you have, see the appropriate page.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Inevitability of the similar doesn't make right</h4>

<p>Ok cool, let's go out to a random parking lot and steal a car. Why not? That person was going to lose possession of that car at some point anyways, whether by the car breaking down, the person dying, or whatnot (if you argue they were going to sell the car, well whatever they spent that money on would reach the same fate). We don't just throw our hands up and say, "well, that person was going to die at some point in the future anyways, so lets kill them now".  If you don't like that answer on humans, try it on stray dogs. Are we allowed to hunt stray golden retrievers?  So carnists only believe this argument anyways when its convenient.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. Hunters aren't culling</h4>

<p>Hunters aren't picking out weak animals that are terminally ill ones.  Generally the most desirable animals are the most virile, strongest, and largest. So this isn't an overpopulation control or act of mercy on the animals.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">6. Side effects</h4>

<p>Hunting and hunting-related practices such as the sale and import of deer carcasses have led to exacerbations in chronic wasting disease.  Attempts have been made to control this by banning certain practices around hunting like baiting. But heaven forbid that includes the hunting itself.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="labgrown.html">ES100</a>: "I'm just waiting for lab grown meat"</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>This line of nonsense is what honestly and sincerely made me make this entire website.  If I keep hearing people parrot this vacuous garbage unopposed I think I'm going to go nuts.</p>

<p>It's a meaningless aphorism designed to kick the can down the road.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Why</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Lab meat isn't a vegan product anyways</h4>

<p>So like it's a completely moot point to begin with.  It's engaged again in harm-reduction rather than elimination because it will still take animals to grow the stock.  Well, I guess I'm very glad that someone went from stealing 100 cars a year to 3, please outline for me how that is now ethical.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Carnists insist it'll magically be less expensive</h4>

<p>Labs are expensive.  How on earth is an already heavily subsidized industry where meat literally grows itself going to be outcompeted by a lab trying to grow a sample in bulk? So even best case scenario it'll be an indefinite "I'm waiting for lab meat to get cheaper" even when it does exist.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Still unsustainable</h4>

<p>This product has all the sustainability problems of meat, but now with the introduction of all the sustainability issues of bulk biomaterial synthesis.  I think meat eaters <strong>seriously</strong> underestimate the amount of animals killed each year. In the US alone, it's almost <a href="https://animalclock.org/">8,500,000,000</a> (yes, that's billion with a B)... <em>just in the United States</em>. Just in terms of cows alone, you're looking at some 100,000 cows' worth of meat grown daily. Animal metabolic processes are already otherworldly in efficiency compared to any biosynthetic process you can dream up. You'll never beat an animal thermodynamically at making meat. So you're not addressing the key energy constraints of this system anyways and it still will hurt other people to eat lab meat, perhaps even more.  </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. All meat isn't the same anyway</h4>

<p>People act like all the sudden one single lab-grown meat specimen is all it will take, like people aren't particular about what kind of steak they get.  As we all know: waygu, filet mignon, ribeye... it's all pretty much the same, right?  Especially when we talk about other animals like pork and chicken. This is again, more nonsense, and the deflection will continue even if one type of lab meat comes into existence.  "Oh I'm waiting for lab meat to be [more/less] [fatty/stringy/hard] and closer to the right [texture/flavor], etc."  The can-kicking will continue indefinitely.  "Sorry, it's just not the right <em>kind</em> of lab meat."</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. Non-meat products</h4>

<p>What about cheese? fish? eggs? etc. So ok, hang with me, instead of a vegan cheeseburger (that you can already buy)... the 'ethical' alternative is going to be an already non-vegan patty (which you will certainly pay more for with all the built-in sustainability issues) lined with... regular cheese? Very nice big-brain solution that accomplishes jack squat.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">6. Substitute for what?</h4>

<p>I'm fully convinced that no one actually believes this line when it comes out of their mouth (or keyboard) anyways. Like they really need a pure 100% 1:1 substitute for the meat patty on their crappy dollar-burger or for the slices of ham in their hot pocket? Give me a break. Seriously. As if the quality of meat on their frozen-puck bread-and-cheese burger is so gourmet that it needs to be grown in a lab and you can't give an inch even if it means slitting the throat of an innocent animal.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">7. There are already vegan alternatives for everything.</h4>

<p>I mean literally everything.  Burger patties, nuggets, wings, fish, cold cuts, sausage links, sausage patties, meatballs, etc. not to mention the non-meat animal products like butter, cheese (every kind - cheddar, provolone, mozzarella - you name it), milk, yogurt, whipped cream, egg whites, not to mention you can buy vegan cheesesteaks, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, sub sandwiches, corn dogs, hearty soups, pies, brownies, cookies, you name it. Literally everything. Some of these... get this... are better than the originals and more nutritious.</p>

<p>So what more do you want? It's just always not good enough</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">8. If you're not vegan by now, lab meat won't change that</h4>

<p>This line about lab-meat is just pure BS, designed to kick the can down the road and deflect responsibility.  "There's literally nothing I can do, lab meat doesn't exist!" Give me a break, if you parrot this line: quit waiting for other people to do things for you, grow a spine, and take moral accountability.</p>

<p>--</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="local.html">ES200</a>: 'Locally sourced meat' is humane - as long as I avoid 'factory farming' I'm ok</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here claims that it's ok to eat food from non-factory farmed sources. Or 'humanely slaughtered' animals. Or whatever.  Also stated as "our animals have all good days and one bad day".</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. "Of course Factory Farming is an abomination..."</h4>

<p>With all due respect, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPzDP-FEXBQ">Stefan Molyneux saying this</a> is worth about as much as "Thoughts and prayers for the animals RIP"... that and 25 cents buys you a newspaper.  It's totally devoid of any accountability. It's also the immediate go-to point reached for by <a href="https://youtu.be/PAOzGNFamgQ">Matt Dillahunty</a>... before he admitted that he ate meat at a restaurant the night before.  Any anytime sourcing is brought up, it's about antibiotics and meat quality, and I haven't heard a single carnist 'thinker' say that they avoid literally all meat they object to the source of on ethical grounds. So if you're anything like these 'public intellectuals' that have talked to vegans about veganism, you don't even believe this argument anyway.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. 'Humane' meat is a nonsense oxymoron</h4>

<p>Ok, Ted Bundy took in well-to-do attractive young girls and gave them 'one bad day'. Is that now ethical? What if you marry someone, provide for them, etc. and then give them the same 'one bad day' treatment? What if I did the same to a human child that I had cared for since birth? How is it humane, compassionate, or benevolent, to put a bolt through the head of an animal that does not want to die, purely for your 'one good day' of entertainment? It just isn't.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Collateral damage</h4>

<p>By killing animals, you're still hurting other people, starving people of needed food, and destroying the environment.  The 'good days' you gave that animal weren't so good for those you hurt along the way, either.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="parttime.html">ES300</a>: "I'm trying to be a part-time vegetarian"</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist claims moral superiority over other carnists by not doing immoral things too much.  That title <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VeganForCircleJerkers/comments/qnj9do/trying_to_date_as_an_ethical_vegan_is_the_most/">is an actual quote</a> by the way.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Thanks, I guess...?</h4>

<p>I'm very glad that you decided that you should only steal a little, rape a little, kill a little. Baby steps I guess. Also I'm very glad that you're trying to try. Can't promise to try, but I'm trying to try... sometimes.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. This is self-gratification with no accountability</h4>

<p>Can I call it for what is? "I don't eat too much meat" is code for "I want to feel good myself but make no ethical choices". To you I can only ask: How does it feel to have no spine?</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="circle.html">ES400</a>: There is 'a circle of life'</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist claims eating meat is ok because it's all part of the "Circle of Life"</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. The "Circle of Life" doesn't exist</h4>

<p>It's a made up theme song for a disney movie.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. This doesn't apply anywhere else</h4>

<p>Can I kill another person and claim 'circle of life' as a defense?  Can I claim that stealing is ok because of some imagined 'cycle of ownership' where "you get things, you lose them, you give them away, someone else gets those things... you know. The cycle of ownership". Me stealing your car is part of this cycle.  It's like the <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/water-cycle/">water cycle</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_cycle">the nitrogen cycle</a> but for your stuff.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Animal agriculture is destroying the 'Circle of Life'</h4>

<p>Carnism has huge ecological impacts and is the number-one cause of global warming. To claim that this is just some part of a natural 'circle of life' that gives you moral impunity to put frozen beef pucks in your shopping cart is an insult to intelligent discourse.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="commonground.html">ES500</a>: We need to find common ground</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here claims that 'finding some common ground' is necessary, and that vegans shouldn't be so militant, because that undermines veganism</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. "Here's how to spread a position I don't believe in"</h4>

<p>Carnists are imagining themselves to be world-class experts on spreading a position they themselves don't subscribe to. You haven't been convinced of the position, so why should I listen to you on what's most convincing?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. It means nothing</h4>

<p>100% of the time I have encountered this argument, it concretely means one of the following two things:\</p>

<ul>
<li>"I am against some low-hanging-fruit animal abuse X that I don't engage in, let's not focus on my own actions, let's just all be against X"</li>
<li>"Never talk about veganism ever, that's the best way to spread veganism"</li>
</ul>

<p>Actually the first point is being highly generous.  In a lot of cases, people say they're against factory farming, for instance, but eat McDonalds and buy frozen chicken wings by the gross - So it means literally nothing in that case.  At best it means 'I eat meat but am against horse racing - and all that veganism should be against is horse racing.  Don't be against meat eating or anything!'.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. It's concern trolling</h4>

<p>This is the classic line of "It hurts your cause to go after issue [thing that affects me] or to tell me I should [do something more than jack squat]; you would gain more support if you went after something I didn't participate in... or were gentler by recommending I made no changes. I just really want this whole project of ending animal cruelty to be a success and I'm concerned you're not going to be successful if you tell people to do anything different. That would be like... so sad. You don't want <em>more</em> animals hurt, do you??"  Miss me with that.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="personal.html">ES600</a>: "it's a personal choice"</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>"I say live and let live; whether or not I eat meat is a personal choice"</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Every choice you make is technically a personal choice</h4>

<p>So, that is a vacuous statement</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Eating meat affects others</h4>

<p>It hurts animals, other people, and the environment. So it technically is no more a personal choice than any other type of immoral activity. Is stealing a personal choice? Is murder? That can't be a serious defense of an accusion that you've harmed a victim in literally any other context.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="capitalism.html">ES700</a>: "There is no ethical consumption under capitalism!"</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist throws this phrase out as though it holds meaning.  What it means is a form of moral nihilism which states that it doesn't matter whether you buy animal corpses to eat or plants to eat, they were both made from capitalist exploitation of the working class and therefore are <em>equally</em> unethical. </p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Why does everyone say those exact latter five words?</h4>

<p>It's a sign that there's a lack of clear thinking, when you're just repeating a phrase.  Consider almost any other argument on this list, it has a lot of different phrasings with synonyms, or rearragements, etc. Why is it that the sequence of words 'no ethical consumption under capitalism' is the sole expression this vacuous sentiment?  Interesting to note.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. That is literally <em>carte blanche</em> for <strong>any action</strong> ever taken</h4>

<p>If you do anything ever, and you live in a capitalist country, and you bought either food to live while you do a thing or a tool to do it with, and therefore now everything ever is morally justified, because you can always deflect that the original consumption as being unethical.  "Should I use this hacksaw to build a shed for my neighbor or murder them?  Doesn't matter! No ethical consumption under capitalism, hyuck!". But surely the people proposing this nonsense don't believe it. It's just deflection.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Meat increases consumption</h4>

<p>By buying meat, you're increasing the amount of consumption of food in order to feed the livestock. So even if you blanket cover all consumption under this umbrella, shouldn't you still choose the smallest amount of unethical consumption?  </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Carnists don't even believe their own argument</h4>

<p>Many liberals boycott Chik-fil-A on account of their religious conservatism.  Why is it all of the sudden the default liberal position that any consumption under capitalism is equally wrong?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. Things aren't equally wrong</h4>

<p>Stealing $5, murder, buying a vegan sandwich, and throwing a baby chick alive into a shredder can't all be 'equally wrong', if the word "morality" is to mean anything. That's just absurd</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="nonarable.html">GE100</a>: Animals are farmed on non-arable land that cannot be used for plants</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that animal agriculture is sustainable because it uses land that otherwise would not be able to be used for growing food</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's just not true on our planet</h4>

<p>While it is theoretically possible in some alternate universe that we could be growing free-range meat on soil that otherwise is unfit for growing crops, that just isn't the case in our actual reality. <a href="https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/food_practice/sustainable_production/soy/">80% of the soy we grow</a> goes towards feeding animals. The US alone <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat">could feed 800 million people</a> with just our food supply. <a href="https://www.forksoverknives.com/wellness/animal-agriculture-hunger-and-how-to-feed-a-growing-global-population-part-one-of-two/">The sole reason for worldwide hunger</a> is that food is fed to livestock while people suffer in hunger.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Eating animal products hurts people</h4>

<p>If you are still consuming products at this point, then you are contributing to an unsustainable ecology that hurts people. The fact that it might be possible in some alternate universe that it wouldn't be the case that people die for your entertainement is irrelevent.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Hurting animals is still unethical</h4>

<p>It's impossible to get past the fact that it isn't ethical to kill something that doesn't want to die, and so there's no way to skirt that issue by claiming that "it's just so economical to hang animals upside down as they panic and put bolts through their heads and slit their throats". That is just not a response that makes any sense in any other context.  We wouldn't accept it for human slavery, and we therefore shouldn't accept it for animals.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="freerange.html">GE101</a>: 'Free range' or grass-fed meat is sustainable</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here attempts to claim that if everyone ate grass-fed beef it would be more sustainable.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Then why do factory farms exist?</h4>

<p>If this argument were true, then Factory farms wouldn't exist.  Why would you pay someone to truck in soy, corn and grain from other farms when you can let animals openly graze on mostly empty land in the middle of nowhere and essentially feed themselves? It simply isn't true. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Greenhouse gas Emissions</h4>

<p>Besides issues of <a href="https://www.forksoverknives.com/the-latest/no-grass-fed-beef-not-better-planet/">overgrazing</a> and <a href="https://awellfedworld.org/issues/climate-issues/grass-fed-beef/">reduction in beef supply</a> that would result from a switch to all-grass-fed beef supply, substaintial <a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/grass-fed-beef-will-not-help-tackle-climate-change-report-finds-2492451529.html">greenhouse gas emissions</a> would result. </p>

<p>The amazon is already being burned to clear land for animal agriculture.  This will additional land use just make it worse.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Ethical Implications</h4>

<p>This still doesn't address the ethical issues around killing and imprisoning animals that don't wish to die.  To the argument that animals are suffering needlessly for your entertainment, you can't simply respond "Yeah, but hey the good news is I found a way to make that more ecologically sustainable!" </p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="byproducts.html">GE102</a>: Farmed animals are fed food byproducts and not food</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist claims that agricultural byproducts are used to feed animals, not food that humans eat.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Quick question</h4>

<p>They why are people paying money to feed <a href="https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/food_practice/sustainable_production/soy/">80% of the world's soy</a> to animals when they could get the otherwise useless husks of human food to feed to them? Why can we feed <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat">800 million people</a> from the grain in this country alone, but then have people be starving? It doesn't make any sense. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Ethics</h4>

<p>It doesn't matter what you feed a caged animal that you then slaughter, this act is inherently immoral, and even if it were true that it is more ecologically sustainable, that would not justify it.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="california.html">GE200</a>: Almonds are consuming California's water supply</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that almonds are bad for the environment</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Have a problem with a specific food? Don't eat it.</h4>

<p>Veganism isn't <em>carte blanche</em> to do literally anything that doesn't hurt animals directly.  If you have a problem with a specific product, even if it contains no animal products, then don't use it.  To say there's a problem with product X isn't an attack on veganism just because they typically consume product X. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Dairy is still more water intensive to produce</h4>

<p><a href="https://foodrevolution.org/blog/almonds-sustainability/">A cup of dairy milk requires <strong>over 10 times</strong> the amount of water to produce as almond milk</a>. So, even though water-starved California is using 8% of its water supply in growing the entire US almond supply, it's still three times less water than is used for growing cows in that same state.  </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Water doesn't address the ethical implications</h4>

<p>"Sustainability tho" is not an acceptable defense to slaughtering calves for veal to harvest the mother's milk, and for starving humans to feed the lifestock.  There is an inordinate amount of suffering associated with dairy milk even if it were more sustainable.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="sustainable.html">GE201</a>: 'Sustainable Fishing' is important</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea here is that as long as you catch your fish in a sustainable way, then it's all good.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's a meaningless term</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nationalfisherman.com/viewpoints/national-international/losing-grounds-self-report-or-report-by-force/">'sustainable fishing'</a> regulations work on self-reporting, and super-special pinky swearing to be super honest. Somehow <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2018.00098/full">50 million fish go unreported</a>. The mysteries of life. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. A losing battle</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.milliondollarvegan.com/sustainable-fishing/">'Sustainable fish stocks are continually declining'</a>.  In other words, sustainable fishing isn't sustainable itself.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Marine Side Effects</h4>

<p>Bycatch, including sharks, has <a href="https://today.tamu.edu/2020/07/22/study-shows-alarming-decline-in-shark-numbers-around-the-world/">caused massive declines in unfished populations of marine animals</a>.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaquita">vaquita is on the verge of extinction</a>, for instance, due to becoming bycatch in shrimp and fish nets and trawlers.</p>

<p>'Sustainable fishing' also doesn't address the amount of crap thrown in the ocean. <a href="https://www.livekindly.co/fishing-nets-not-plastic-straws-make-up-nearly-half-of-ocean-plastic-pollution/">50% of the plastic in the ocean is discarded or lost fishing nets</a>.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Ethical</h4>

<p>Given that you are killing animals that don't want to die, by plastic, by bycatch, and on your plate, the idea that you could do it indefinitely can't be a defense to doing it in the first place. Human slavery is highly sustainable, but still is morally indefensible.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="deforestation.html">GE300</a>: Tropical fruit X causes deforestation</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea is that we shouldn't go vegan because land in third-world countries is used to make: avocados, mangos, etc.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Penny wise, pound foolish</h4>

<p>The mass deforestation in south and central america <a href="https://www.animalagricultureclimatechange.org/80-of-the-amazon-is-being-burned-for-cattle-ranching-and-cattle-feed-plantations/">is from animal agriculture</a>. So, yes, avocados use some land as well, but if you stopped eating meat, the amount of land usage would, in net, shrink.  </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Have a problem with a food? Don't eat it.</h4>

<p>You can't attack veganism by attacking a particular food.  That doesn't suddenly make meat more sustainable. If you think that you should not eat a particular food on ethical grounds, even if it doesn't contain animal products, then great! Do that!</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="agriculture.html">GE400</a>: Animal Agriculture is not the largest contributor to climate change</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that one can add up other things to make an even greater total</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's disingenuous</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/diet-fitness/vegan-eating-would-slash-cut-food-s-global-warming-emissions-n542886">Everyone going vegan</a> would cut climate emissions by 29%.  The counterargument that carnists put forth is that "Well, if you add up transportation of everything from humans themselves to textiles to sheet metal, you end up with a larger number".  First, <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/02/what-is-in-that-truck-i-just-passed-on-the-highway.html">animal agriculture makes up a significant portion of transportation</a>, including <a href="https://kanhaul.com/news/kan-hauls-food-transportation-infographic/">food imports, the majority of which are animal products</a>. But whatever, lets ignore all that.</p>

<p>Imagine this scenario: consider what it would mean if 29% of greenhouse gas emissions could be attributed to specifically 2-in-1 shampoo, and that you could lower your greenhouse gas emissions by 29% just using shampoo and conditioner separately?  Would it be fair to say "well, yeah but add up my driving, and that all together along with anything I've ever bought in a store ever (including my using clothes, computers, appliances, office supplies, etc.) and the movement of any product ever needed to deliver any service (from the metal that makes the cell towers to the wood that makes up my house). All of that added together makes up more greenhouse gas emissions than my 2-in-shampoo!  Owned!"</p>

<p>Obviously you can add up together the emissions of a bunch of products and services and give it a single label.  "Industry". "Transportation".  Those each are huge arrays of services and products you use.  "Agriculture" in any pie chart of emissions, to within a rounding error, represents only products involving the slaughter of animals.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">It's irrelevant?</h4>

<p>What if it was the number two cause of climate change, would that change the fact that you could cut your footprint by 29% by eliminating animal cruelty from your life by making very easy choices?  I mean, does that seriously change anything at all about the argument?</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="overrun.html">GF100</a>: Animals will overrun the earth if we don't eat them</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here claims that eating animals is justified because otherwise they will overpopulate the earth</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Searching for any justification</h4>

<p>There is a similar claim that most carnists make that farmed animals will go extinct if we don't eat them.  So which is it?  The answer is that whichever one suits the narrative</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Cats and Dogs?</h4>

<p>We generally don't eat cats and dogs.  Do they overrun the earth?  What about other herbivorous animals like guinea pigs, hamsters, and buffalo?  There's no precedent to believe this is the case.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Farming already takes subsidies and interventions</h4>

<p>Keeping animals is very expensive and labor intensive.  It requires a lot of water and other resources.  Farming animals in a lot of cases already takes subsidies just to keep profitable.  Similarly, animal agriculture requires a significant amount of intervention, such as artificial insemination to keep the animal population at a significant enough level that we can eat and farm them.  There's no reason to think they will overrun everything.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="extinct.html">GF101</a>: Farmed animals will go extinct if we don't eat them</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist idea is that not eating meat is doing a disservice to animals because otherwise they would die out because there would be no financial incentive to keep them alive</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Which is it?</h4>

<p>Carnists will variously claim that they will go extinct or <a href="overrun.html">overrun</a> us. Which one was it?  It seems like there's a lot of baseless scavenging for arguments.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Has this ever happened?</h4>

<p>Give me one example.  We stopped eating american bison and their population rebounded. Is there any evidence at all or is this another baseless claim used to filibuster with stupid arguments?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Deforestation and overfishing</h4>

<p>Overfishing (also known as regular fishing) and deforestation (for which animal agriculture is the number one contributor) are killion biodiversity. So, if you really want to maintain biodiversity, eating animals is the sure way to destroy it.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Ethics</h4>

<p>Let's ignore this baseless claim that it helps biodiversity (rather than what it really does, which is harm it). Is there any ethical justification to continue hurting animals that you're going to keep the species or subspecies going?  Like is it worth keeping dogfighting going because you're really concerned that your particular breed of dogfighting dog might die out and therefore dogfighting is ethically justified?</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="released.html">GF102</a>: Farmed animals would be killed in the wild if we let them go</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that if we let animals go they will die in the wild</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Why not just stop breeding them?</h4>

<p>Ok so the only option is to keep breeding them for slaughter?  How does that justify you ordering a cheeseburger and continuing the demand for animal breeding?  It logically doesn't follow from the premises that therefore <em>you</em> need to keep eating meat.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. It doesn't justify the treatment of animals</h4>

<p>It also doesn't logically follow that you need to keep them locked in tiny cages, wallowing in their own feces.  If you really think that you should have a sanctuary for animals you should try to open one, not justify the torture of animals to yourself.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="people.html">GM100</a>: People would lose their jobs if the entire world went vegan</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that animal agriculture is required to keep the animal agriculture economy going</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. That doesn't justify your choices</h4>

<p>Ok so if the entire world went vegan at the snap of a finger that would have drastic immediate economic effects. That imaginary scenario is just not good enough for why <strong>you</strong> choose to impose suffering on some singular animal. You can't justify throwing baby chicks alive into shredders with "yeah well it's keeping the economy going.  Where are all the now unemployed chick shredders going to find jobs? And the people designing the chick shredding devices? Gosh."  It's just skirting responsibility.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. That doesn't work for slavery</h4>

<p>We don't say "well, slavery is ethically justified because someone might have just bought a slave, and therefore they would be very sad if they lost their possession, so let's keep that going indefinitely".  That's not a moral argument. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Git gud</h4>

<p>If your only skill is throwing baby chicks into shredders, maybe you deserve to lose your job.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="livestock.html">GM101</a>: Domestic Livestock are the currency of the world's poor</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>Veganism is wrong because if the world went vegan poor people in poor countries would lose their life savings.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. That doesn't justify your choices</h4>

<p>Ok, so there is some family in Uganda that just used their family savings to purchase 3 goats - and if the entire world went vegan at the snap of a finger then they would be out their entire life savings. That is just not good enough for why <strong>you</strong> choose to impose suffering on some singular animal.  Could you imagine you walk in on someone throwing a bunch of baby chickens into a shredder alive. "What are you doing" "Oh I'm defending the world's poor! Without me throwing these chicks into shredders, a family in Uganda would be sad."  It's ridiculous.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Third-world poverty is driven by affluent western carnism</h4>

<p>Many countries export their food as livestock feed that would otherwise be used to alleviate hunger in those countries.  By you not going vegan, you are exacerbating poor living conditions in those countries you claim to care so much about.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="globalism.html">GM102</a>: veganism promotes globalism</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that veganism promotes globalism because vegans eat food from diverse biomes not grown in America</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Have a problem with a food? Don't eat it.</h4>

<p>If you object to a product that would otherwise be vegan, I, as you vegan godfather, hereby grant you permission to exclude it from your diet.  Do you morally object to mangoes? Great! Don't eat mangoes. That doesn't mean that you get to torture and murder animals because mangoes are bad.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Grow your own</h4>

<p>Hydroponics exist. Gardens exist. LED lights exist. If you want to grow mangoes in your basement, you now can! </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Meat eating is a far worse source of globalism than any vegetable</h4>

<p>Your burger king burger, for instance, could contain meat <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/04/02/big-mac-fast-food-snacks-burgers_n_5075546.html">from 1000 cows across 5 countries</a>. But it's easy to point to a mango and say "Hey, that doesn't grow here!". It's harder when it's just blended into a paste that looks the same whether it's from New Zealand or Brazil. This whole project of stealing food from countries that need it that pays for itself by stealing money from western countries through corporate subsidies - well, it doesn't get more globalist than that!</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="restricts.html">GM103</a>: veganism restricts access to items</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea here is that veganism hurts people by restricting access to clothes or food</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. That describes everything</h4>

<p>Any time you don't do something immoral for personal gain you're restricting your access to that gain.  You can't kill that guy over there and take his money - that restricts your access to money.  I mean, what does that even mean?</p>

<p>If you refuse to purchase products made from slavery then that restricts your access to those products.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. No one is taking it away from you</h4>

<p>You convincing someone that consuming animal products is immoral and them thereby choosing not to engage in the use of those products is not the same as 'restricting their access to' it.  That's an inaccurate use of language.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="already.html">GM200</a>: Animal is already dead so what does it matter if you eat it?</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist claims that an animal is already dead at the time of purchase, so purchasing an animal product is not unethical.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Supply and demand</h4>

<p>By purchasing the product you're creating the demand for the product. If a grocery store sells fewer steaks, they order fewer from the supplier, who orders fewer cows to be slaughtered, which in turn creates fewer cows.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. "But it's not instant"</h4>

<p>Yes, that feedback process is not instaneous.  No one is waiting with a knife in the back of the grocery store to kill an animal. That still doesn't mean that creating a demand for that product and normalizing its use to those around you is ethical.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. It doesn't work in any other context</h4>

<p>Would you questions buying a product from a store if I confirmed for you that it was created using slave labor? What if I told you "you can have this wallet - oh I got it from a guy I killed."  Would you think any differently about it?  What's it matter? He's already dead. </p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="payment.html">GM201</a>: I'm not killing an animal, I'm paying for killing an animal</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>This argument is a claim that carnists don't actually kill the animals, they are simply paying for meat</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. You're still creating the demand for the products</h4>

<p>When you go to a store and purchase e.g. a bag of frozen chicken, you advance the delivery of the next box of frozen animal corpses by one bag.  The supplier orders another box one bag earlier, and therefore another bag's worth of chickens are trucked in to the facility.  When you buy animal products, you are still the cause of the animal dying, it's just pinballed through this system.  </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. It's not ethical in any other context</h4>

<p>No one breaks down an action into multiple steps and then claims that the break down somehow changes the ethical nature of their actions. e.g. "I didn't kill him, I just squeezed the trigger of the gun pointed at his head.  That caused the firing pin to be dropped on the prime of the bullet, which caused gunpowder to ignite, which caused.... .... so anyways all I'm guilty of is dropping a firing pin!"  That's just absurd. You increased the demand for animal products.  That caused more animals to die</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Having intermediaries isn't absolution</h4>

<p>In no other context is paying for something ok when the action is illegal.  Fencing stolen items is immoral because stealing is immoral and you are feeding the thief. Hiring a hitman is immoral because you're paying someone to do something immoral. There's no where else in life where payment somehow launders the action ethically.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="priviledge.html">GM300</a>: Being vegan is a priviledge of modernity</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that it's unreasonable to expect everyone to go vegan, especially if they live in poor communities or third-world countries where food deserts or lack of choices exist</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Is this you?</h4>

<p>If you're reading this, you're probably on the internet looking at an LED screen on a ~$1000 electronic device. You know how to read and write, and you definitely have the priviledge of modernity.  So what's <strong>your</strong> excuse?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. By eating meat you're denying modernity to others</h4>

<p>Third world countries continue to struggle and widespread meat-caused global food shortages simply do not help.  By eating meat, you are helping ensure that the ceiling is as low as possible crushing down on the people you supposedly care so much about.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. It's just not true</h4>

<p>"Beans and rice" is synonymous with cheap living.  If you actually list off other 'cheap foods' they are all vegan, like lentils, soybeans, or wheat.  If you're concerned with third-world countries, just consider places like Koh Phangan in Thailand which is described as 'vegan paradise', or Israel, which has a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2133401583575593">completely vegan city</a>.  Plenty of other 'third world' countries regularly make lists for places for vegans to visit, like <a href="https://www.happycow.net/vegtopics/travel/top-vegan-friendly-cities">Ho Chi Minh City</a>. So it's vaguely true at best.  In most of these places, the critical missing component isn't the actual food, it's just widespread ignorance and entrenched cultural beliefs.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. This is not an argument against veganism</h4>

<p>It's an argument against vegans being 'judgemental'. But that's already just <a href="judgemental.html">a carnist stereotype</a> of vegans. This is just another claim intended to stigmatize veganism in order to deflect responsibility.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="expensive.html">GM301</a>: Being vegan is expensive</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that it's unreasonable to expect everyone to go vegan because it just costs too much</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Vegan food isn't actually more expensive</h4>

<p>"Beans and rice" is synonymous with cheap living.  If you don't believe that vegan food is cheap, I want you to consider the largest food retailer near my house in the midwest, and the following prices I just grabbed (more or less by randomly searching) as of 12/11/2021 listed on their site (None of these items were on sale at the time), sorted by grams protein per dollar since carnists are so obsessed with protein:</p>

<p>|food                                         |size   |cost   |calories|g protein|cal/$|gprot/$|g protein/cal|cholesterol|

<p>This isn't to say that somehow vegan foods demolish carnist foods every time.  But looking at that list, you'd be hard-pressed to say that vegan food is <strong>so</strong> much more expensive than carnist food. Especially given that 1. all those carnist food are heavily subsidized and 2. laden with antibiotics, cholesterol, and E Coli. If you go to grab more comparable products like antibiotic-free eggs, the price hikes by 55%, dropping it to 26 g protein/dollar, which is dead even with tofu.</p>

<p>This also does not constitute an endorsement of any product listed herein or the Kroger company.  Look around at your own local food retailer. If their prices aren't online take some pictures of items in the store with your phone and then make your own spreadsheet. I'd be surprised if anyone walked away from that exercise thinking that vegan food is only for the rich.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Ethical Implications</h4>

<p>Even though vegan foods are just not any more expensive than carnist food, you simply cannot justify torturing animals by saying "it's so economical".  So what if your premade corn dogs now are double the price per ounce? Consider it a tax for never having to eat extruded pig rectum again. </p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="industry.html">GM400</a>: "It's not people; it's big industry hurting the environment"</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea here is that it's not your personal choices which are causing climate change, it's 'big industry' and we need regulation to fix it.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's a load of crap</h4>

<p>This is another case of people <a href="already.html">pretending to not understand</a> how supply and demand work. Industries don't make stuff if nobody buys it. By buying it you're creating the demand for the product, and contributing to the collateral damage.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. You want to regulate a change you don't want to make</h4>

<p>So let me get this straight: You don't want to eat vegan food, you want to keep eating your ground beef or whatever. So what's the big brain idea here to reduce beef emissions? Legally force you to eat less meat? That's what the regulations would have to do.  But then carnists would go down kicking and screaming.  So what's the actual plan here? Regulations won't make <a href="agriculture.html">beef</a> or <a href="sustainable.html">fish</a> less environmentally destructive without limiting consumption. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. It's deflecting responsibility</h4>

<p>No, <strong>you</strong> need to take responsibility for <strong>your</strong> choices.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. The ethical implications remain</h4>

<p>You're still killing an animal that doesn't want to die for your own entertainment.  It doesn't matter if you can shove off the environmental and human impact onto someone else. </p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="cholesterol.html">HD100</a>: High cholesterol isn't bad for you</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>Carnists make a variety of claims regarding cholesterol, including the denialism high cholesterol causes heart disease.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. This has already been fully debunked</h4>

<p>These arguments are <a href="https://sentientdarkness.medium.com/comprehensive-debunk-of-an-anti-vegan-nutrition-copypasta-e677a538cc16">tired</a> and have been routinely demolished. The TL;DR is they rely on scientific papers with small sample sizes and other methodological problems, or all cite a small handful of authors that essentially republish the same meta analyses and reviews repeatedly in an effort to fake scientific consensus.</p>

<p>The AHA (the multi-billion-dollar medical research organization charged with the CPR certification of essentially every healthcare worker in America) puts it in no uncertain terms on their site that <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/about-cholesterol">cholesterol</a>, in particular <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/hdl-good-ldl-bad-cholesterol-and-triglycerides">LDL</a>, causes heart disease. </p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="nutrients.html">HN100</a>: You can't get nutrient X on a vegan diet</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that carnism is necessary because a vegan diet can't deliver certain nutrients.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. You can take a supplement or eat fortified foods</h4>

<p>There are always a large number of ways to acquire certain nutrients, killing animals isn't required to be one of them. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Carnists pay little attention to such deficiencies themselves</h4>

<p>At best, carnists are ignoring the deficiencies they themselves can get. Is it fair to make a list of stuff that one gets more readily from plant foods like folate, Vitamin C, potassium, or magnesium as an argument against carnism?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. These lists sometimes go fishing for micronutrients to claim</h4>

<p>Cholesterol isn't some high-value micronutrient that vegans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/health#wiki_6._nutritional_deficiencies">aren't getting in their diet</a>.  Get out of here with that, and other 'conditionally essential' items like Carnitine or creatine. These lists are created to be impressive and difficult to debunk due to the sheer volume of bad arguments.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="protein.html">HN101</a>: Veganism is associated with protein deficiency</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that carnism is necessary to avoid protein deficiency</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems with this argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Protein is just as easily available on a vegan as a carnist diet</h4>

<p><a href="expensive.html">As shown in debunking the myth that vegan food is expensive</a>, protein isn't any less available on a vegan versus a carnist diet. So this argument doesn't make any sense.  It stems from people associating the word 'protein' with 'meat' but in reality foods like ground beef is a very poor source of protein and are demolished in cost per gram of protein and protein per calorie of foods like tofu and lentils.  It actually also loses in a head-to-head match against most vegan ground beef crumbles, the antibiotics and hormones nonwithstanding.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. People don't understand macronutrients</h4>

<p>Given that an average 38-year-old male, 5'10", 160 lbs needs <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/calorie-calculator/itt-20402304">2250 calories</a> and <a href="https://www.calculator.net/protein-calculator.html">60-ish grams</a> (depending on whom you ask) of protein, you can get your entire protein requirements from eating only potatoes in a day (Same with, say, an average female of 5'7" and 150 lbs).  Whole day, nothing but dry potatoes, your protein goal is met. "But potatoes are just a starch!" Yes, but this idea that you need an insane amount of protein is blown out of proportion. I can't help but thing that there's got to be some underlying thing where somehow people think that just eating protein without exercise is somehow going to put them in better shape or something.  This lasts right up until the heart attack.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124841/">only 5% of people are meeting their daily fiber requirements</a>.  So, no, you don't need protein.  Eat a vegetable.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="shill.html">HO100</a>: Any doctor promoting veganism is a shill</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea here is that veganism is so unhealthy that obviously one could never promote such a diet without being a shill</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Evidence Please?</h4>

<p>I haven't actually run across any doctor that provably has a conflict of interest in the direction of veganism. One can always unfalsifiably claim 'Study X would have found that veganism is bad if not for the interest of the people leading it', but without any clear connection, it's indisputable. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Veganism has no vested interest, meat production does</h4>

<p>Meat production in the US is highly subsidized by tax dollars, and consumes much more resources than otherwise vegan alternatives. So if there were a 'big tofu', they would also be vested in increasing animal agriculture since most soy grown worldwide is fed to farm animals. Same for resources like water or grain.  There definitely is 'big beef'; there is no 'big vegan'.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Oh, you mean like this?</h4>

<p>Would <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2021.1974336">this paper</a> be an example of shilling? Particularly the part where "This study was funded in part via an unrestricted research grant from the Beef Checkoff, through the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. The sponsor of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report."  Or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34712894/">this one</a>, which has negative things to say about vegetarianism in kids, funded by, again, the Beef Checkoff. In some cases they are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030917401400196X?via%3Dihub">conducted directly</a> by this organization.  What is this Beef Checkoff? Per <a href="https://www.beefboard.org/checkoff/">their website</a>, "The Beef Checkoff program is a national marketing and research program designed to increase the demand for beef at home and abroad. This can be accomplished through initiatives such as consumer advertising, marketing partnerships, public relations, education, research and new-product development." Or <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/11/1695/htm">this one</a> funded by Astrazeneca, makers of Crestor. </p>

<p>This is from just poking around for a few minutes.  Someone ought to make a more complete list (most articles have funding within the fulltext that is typically behind paywalls). If someone puts a more comprehensive list online somewhere I'll link to it.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="athletes.html">HP100</a>: Veganism doesn't let athletes perform to the highest level</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that carnism is necessary for peak athletic performance, and therefore is justified</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Are you a top athlete?</h4>

<p>Put down the Doritos.  This isn't you.  Every time I enter into a discussion with people about top athletic performance I get the sensation as though they feel it somehow trickles down to them when they haven't lifted a weight in their life. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Meat is not necessary for peak performance</h4>

<p>Plenty of research shows the bioavailability of nutrients and performance of atheletes is not tied to athletic performance. For more information consult the film <a href="https://gamechangersmovie.com/">Game Changers</a>. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Even if it was</h4>

<p>Is pure peak athletic performance worth killing animals for?  "Let's see how much one man can deadlift.  To really test this out, we'll need to kill some animals." This is not sound reasoning. Generally carnists tend to agree that dogfighting is immoral, and that seeing the best-fighting dog isn't worth the suffering imposed on these animals.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="topathletes.html">HP101</a>: Almost no top athletes in field X are vegan</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that carnism makes for the best athletes, as evidenced by the superiority of carnist athletes</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. You're not a top athlete</h4>

<p><a href="athletes.html">Again</a>, I get the sense that carnists think there's some kind of trickle-down effect that happens here, where somehow the fact that superior athletes eat meat somehow translates to their own health as they wipe the cheeto dust from their hands to type their arguments out on the internet.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. There is a participation gap</h4>

<p>Consider chess: the top men routinely demolish the top women, but that has nothing to do with gender differences but everything to do with <a href="https://en.chessbase.com/post/what-gender-gap-in-chess">the participation gap</a>. Average men and women are comparable, but when you compare the best of the best, the group with single-digit-percent representation is always going to have a hard time competing by the numbers even if their skill is independent of their grouping.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="supplementation.html">HP102</a>: Vegan athletes require supplements</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that vegan athletes require supplementation, so therefore there is something wrong with veganism</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. You're not a top athlete</h4>

<p><a href="topathletes.html">Again</a>, this isn't you.  You can't justify needlessly killing animals because some athlete somewhere has to take a supplement.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Carnist athletes supplement too</h4>

<p>So what is your point?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. That still isn't worth it</h4>

<p>Even if vegans did and carnists didn't supplement, you can't justify needlessly killing animals by saying that you're avoiding reaching for a box of protein powder or some vitamins or whatever.  Oh no, Patrik Baboumian drinks protein shakes? He should torture animals instead.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="omnivores.html">HP200</a>: Humans are Omnivores</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that humans can eat meat and therefore it is ok to do so</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Physiological capacity is not presriptive</h4>

<p>The fact that your body can do something, or even that it's physically geared towards doing something, doesn't mean that it should.  If you are a male of good strength, you possess all of the tools you need to rape.  That doesn't mean that you should be 'omnivorous' with regards to consensual and non-consensual sex.  Also, heroin allegedly feels amazing.  Should you do heroin now because your neurons are geared towards flooding your brain with neurotransmitters when you take it?  This is an absurd argument.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. No individual body part arguments work either</h4>

<p>People love to use "we evolved X to eat meat", but <a href="developed.html">that doesn't work either</a></p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="malnutrition.html">HX100</a>: A vegan family had a baby that suffered from malnutrition once</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim is intended to sow the seeds of doubt by claiming that some vegan family had a child that died of malnutrition, </p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. "Man bites dog"</h4>

<p>Uncommon events are given massive press coverage, particularly when they speak to narratives we construct in our heads, in order to generate clicks.  In the realm of <a href="https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubpdfs/fatality.pdf">1300 children</a> died of neglect each year - this is just before Covid.  How many of these stories do you see reported that are not trying to push some specific narrative?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Most of these stories have nothing to do with veganism</h4>

<p>Just from a quick search, <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/malnourished-baby-kept-on-vegan-diet-removed-from-italian-parents/ARVIJO3WQ5NVVR6IEG62ILGLOQ/?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11672246&amp;ref=NZH_FBpage">Here's a story</a> about a family that had a child which also had an untreated congential heart condition.  So the parents have multiple forms of neglect, but veganism is, of course, blamed. <a href="https://www.oxygen.com/crime-news/ryan-sheila-oleary-charged-after-son-dies-of-malnutrition">Here's another story</a> about some people that fed their child a 'raw-food plant-based' diet and the child died after they ignored multiple warning signs over an extended period of time. Just like if you just fed your infant blended lettuce, yes, that's technically also 'a vegan diet', - let's blame veganism for your child's death!, The word "Vegan" is, of course, in the headline. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wjqbem/judge-convicts-parents-after-baby-dies-from-vegan-diet">Here's another story</a> from parents that had a child that died (in part) from dehydration after the parents saw a homepathic doctor which helped them come to a conclusion that their child also needed to be gluten free, and then they fed the child nothing and he died, underweight, with an empty stomach. What word makes the headline? "Vegan". </p>

<p>This horseshit is just journalistic malfeasance, but the list goes on and on for half-baked reporters searching desperately for justification for their own carnism.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Carnism causes worldwide child malnutrition</h4>

<p>If you're so worried about the starving children, consider that your choice to eat animal products <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/jun/06/malnutrition-3-million-deaths-children">is a leading cause of child death by malnutrition worldwide</a>.  People with money and control in these countries export grain fed to livestock in order to satsify the western demand.  So your choice attempt to 'save the children' by concern trolling vegan diets is actually counterproductive.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. What's stopping <strong>you</strong> from going vegan?</h4>

<p>If you're reading this, you're not an infant.  Therefore, you don't need to worry about the implications of veganism for infants if you aren't one.  You can't possibly use that as a justification for killing animals for your own entertainment.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="tried.html">PG100</a>: I tried going vegan but give up if I slip up</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>Some people try veganism but then kind of give up if they find that they unintentially eat animal products or are too weak-willed</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. You need to decide what you want out of life</h4>

<p>Whenever I hear this I can't help but think that the person is searching for the label 'vegan' and wants that to be their label, rather than searching for acting ethically, and the label for a person that does so is 'vegan'.  In other words, some label isn't the goal.  The goal is to not hurt people and animals.</p>

<p>If you are still chasing a label and aren't motivated by reducing harm for it's own sake, <a href="https://www.dominionmovement.com/watch">watch this in its entirety</a>.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="culture.html">PI100</a>: It's our culture to eat meat</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that animal cruelty is a part of a particular culture and is therefore justified as a part of preserving the culture</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's basically three bad arguments rolled together</h4>

<p>People are making three bad arguments, two of which are addressed elsewhere.</p>

<ul>
<li>eating meat is ok because <a href="normal.html">everyone else is doing it</a></li>
<li>eating meat is ok because we've been doing it <a href="thousands.html">for a long time</a></li>
<li>we need to preserve culture (addressed on this page)</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Preserving culture isn't worth animal cruelty</h4>

<p>Cultures change. It once was a sign of status as to how many slaves one owned.  That was not worth holding onto for its own sake.  It was once part of Aztec culture to decapitate people at the top of temples.  Do you really want 'culture' to be <em>carte blanche</em> for <strong>anything</strong>?  Can I claim "suicide bombing is just culture.  It's just another form of communication.  You're saying 'I really don't like your style', just with explosives instead of words"?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Culture</h4>

<p>If you don't think it matters that carnism hurts animals, well it hurts other people too. So is there any significant difference to me justifying nuking a country because it is part of some imagined 'American Culture' of guns and reckless sovereign nation invation? If it doesn't work there, then why does it work for starving other countries of their resources so you can have your 'culture'?  You're still externalizing the costs on other people.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="manly.html">PI101</a>: It's manly to eat meat</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>Guys imagine themselves a regular Ron Swanson, sitting in an old spice commercial, eating bacon like a real man.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. You can just buy manliness?</h4>

<p>If you can buy manliness at the store and it takes no skill, it's not real manliness.  Other people need to do things, hard things, like stand their ground on moral principles. I'm glad that your taking the easy way out is what real manliness is all about.  Go do something impressive.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="extreme.html">PM100</a>: Veganism sounds extreme</h1>

<p>"Vegans are extremists.  I'm all for being a part-time ovo-lacto-pesca-flexitarian between 2-3pm on a Tuesday, but I can't see myself going all the way vegan"
- "I will eat less meat but I don't want to cut it out entirely"
- "A half measure is more appropriate for my lifestyle"</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Meeting halfway doesn't mean anything.</h4>

<p>The halfway point between a double murder and no murder is a single murder, but you'd be hard pressed to say that this fact somehow grants legitimacy to such an action, or that it's somehow ethically justified.  I mean, I guess it's "not as bad", but it's definitely not "good".</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. History is littered with correct 'extreme' examples</h4>

<p>Imagine someone in the mid 1800s in America saying "I don't think we should keep slaves, but I still think only whites should enjoy certain priviledges.  It's the middle ground.  Being completely egalitarian seems 'extreme'."  With hindsight we recognize that the 'middle position' here is still deeply unethical. The fact that something horrible is currently happening isn't justification for a "not as bad" lesser evil being "good".</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. It doesn't matter what it 'sounds like'</h4>

<p>Eating animal products hurts animals, other people, the environment, and yourself. If you want to do that less then ask yourself what the motivation for that is and whether you can carry that all the way to the finish line rather than part-timing the pain.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's not that hard</h4>

<p>Alternatives now exist for literally everything ever.  </p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="comparison.html">VA100</a>: I am annoyed at a vegan's comparison to X</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>This is feigned outrage as a means of avoiding the issue. E.g. towards the claim that it's morally inconsistent to have one standard for human slavery (in America) and another for animal suffering, the dodge is "Oh no, you did not just compare black people to animals!"</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Comparing things isn't equating them</h4>

<p>Let's try this exercise: try thinking of a few similarities and differences between a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geyser">geyser</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano">volcano</a>. .... Whaaaat???!! Oh no, you did not just compare a geyser, which is an interesting feature of some random parks around the world, to a volcano, which actually kill people! Volcanoes actually destroy cities! How can you even compare the two? (I mean, except for the ways in which you just did)</p>

<p>Magnitude is just one scale along which you compare things.  You can compare a puddle and an ocean.  When you compare things you aren't saying they are equal, you're saying that they share some features.  Magnitude is just of them.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. You're missing the point</h4>

<p>The point is that you apply one standard of ethics in one area of life where things are already obviously wrong to you, and a different standard in a different area of life where it seems it's not so obvious. Yes, it's a different area, because the two things that are being compared are different things (If they were the same, there wouldn't be any point in comparing them, would there?). But what the argument that brought you to this page is trying to say is be consistent across these two different areas... that are, again, not the same thing. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. This just dodges the issue, but gives feigned moral superiority</h4>

<p>The point is that carnism hurts animals, the environment, other people, and yourself. Oh you didn't like the way a vegan said something one time?  Ok great, well, carnism still hurts animals, the environment, other people, and yourself.  You stating that you were once offended doesn't counter any of those arguments. It's stating an irrelevant fact.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. I don't know. Maybe you should ask the holocaust victims.</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I totally embrace the comparison to the Holocaust. I feel that violence and suffering of innocents are unjust. I believe that the abuse of humans and animals and the earth come from the same need to dominate others. I feel that I could not save my family, my people, but each time I talk about cruelty to animals and being vegetarian I might be saving another life. After knowing what I know about the Holocaust and about animal exploitation I cannot be anything else but an animal rights advocate.

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="consistency.html">VA200</a>: "Vegans are just gatekeeping environmentalism"</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>This is brought up whenever a moral inconsistency in carnism is uncovered. E.g. Because of the environmental damage done due to <a href="sustainable.html">fishing</a>, vegans will state that pescatarianism are only pretending to care about the environment, and then "miss me with that gatekeeping" is a possible response.  Or same with carnists only pretending to be 'animal lovers'.</p>

<p>Gatekeeping, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gatekeeping/">according to the subreddit</a>, is "when someone takes it upon themselves to decide who does or does not have access or rights to a community or identity."  Examples of gatekeeping include scoffing "Let me know if you want a real beer, not Budweiser" or the classic "Oh you claim to like band X? Name 3 of their albums".  </p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">Vegans aren't going for exclusivity</h4>

<p>We're not trying to play some game where we are in some club and no one else is allowed in.  Vegans are actually just trying to get you to hurt animals and people less. That's it.  It's not about saying that you're faking being an animal lover. They're really calling you a hypocrite. You're not practicing what you're preaching.  The goal isn't like normal gatekeeping which is getting you to stop preaching (e.g. "stop calling that beer" or "stop saying you're a fan of that band").  The goal is to get you to start practicing.</p>

<p>It's not <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gatekeeping/">gatekeeping</a> it's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gatesopencomeonin/">Gates Open Come On In/</a>, just leave the animal abuse behind.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Carnism is still unethical</h4>

<p>It doesn't really matter if you do or don't like certain labels, or you find vegans annoying, or you want to call these attacks 'gatekeeping', or whatever.  The important part is the human and animal suffering that carnism causes.  Everything else is just white noise.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="adhominem.html">VA300</a>: A vegan made an ad hominem argument which discredits their position</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here attempts to claim that any insult a vegan uses constitutes an <em>ad hominem</em> in their position, which invalidates the vegan argument because it is a fallacy</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Any old insult is not an ad hominem</h4>

<p>An ad hominem is very specifically when the conclusion of the argument <strong>is derived from</strong> an attack on the person, not the other way around.  An example might help: one ad hominem is if a vegan responded to a list of criticism of carnism with "You're just arguing for carnism because you're a lazy, self-righteous douche".  In this case, that would be refusing to attack the actual arguments being put forward, and instead just attacking the person instead. You're then hoping for "No, I'm not lazy, I have a job, and how am I a self-righteous douche?" "Oh well let me tell you how..." and now you're discussing the motives for your position than the arguments for it.</p>

<p>What is not an <em>ad hominem</em> is "plants don't feel pain because they don't have a central nervous system, you idiot!".  In this case, you're not intending to discuss the other person's motives, you're adding an insult to the end of an otherwise reasoned position.  The reason to not accept that plants feel pain is the lack of a nervous system not that the carnist is an idiot.</p>

<p>In the first case, the attack on the person is supporting the conclusion; in the second, it is not.  That's the key difference.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Logical fallacies exist in an uncontrained world</h4>

<p>For instance, you may be on a news segment with only 3 minutes to explain a massive position. In this case, sometimes shortcuts are required.  It's easier to say in 500 milliseconds, "dairy is murder," than to draw up a fully qualified thesis on the position given the time contraints. Or if carnists lose patience and are ready to walk away from an argument, then such things tools might be leveraged to force re-engagement. Real life isn't as clear as a sequence of arguments written in symbolic logic. Sometimes you might win the argument in symbolic logic terms, but your opponent just says 'f* off' and walks away. Did you really 'win'? Fallacies are tools that live in a squeaky clean world, but sometimes things are messy.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Or it might be an <em>ad hominem</em></h4>

<p>I don't know; good luck!  Go forth with point 1 and use your own judgement. Just remember: is the argument being made <strong>on the basis</strong> of your character rather than a perky insult that's thrown on the side? </p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="copycat.html">VH100</a>: Why copy meat products if you're against it?</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist claims that vegans are hypocrits because they copy the products they are against?  As the wise and noble Socrates of our time put it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"We have to drive around the city for 2 hours looking for some restuarant that serves "friendly" burgers, which ironically look and taste exactly like hamburgers--which vegetarians object to eating because it's either A) gross or B) murder. If it's so gross, then why go out of your way to eat something exactly like it, asshole?"  - <a href="http://thebestpageintheuniverse.net/c.cgi?u=sponsor">Maddox</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Wait, I thought vegan food was nasty?</h4>

<p>Which is it? Is vegan food gross or is it exactly like non-vegan food? I know the answer: "oh, it's [insert answer with immediate post-hoc justification here]".</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Ethics</h4>

<p>So, by carnists' own admission, there's a product that's cheaper to make, tastes the same, and doesn't come with nearly the ecological, health, and ethical consequences of their favorite product. I literally don't know what else to say.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="veggiename.html">VH101</a>: "Why is it called a veggie burger?"</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here claims that the name 'veggie burger' contains the term 'burger' and therefore is... hypocritical?  Not sure.  The only sure thing is that the carnist is angry about it. "Vegan ice cream", oh no!</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Which is it?</h4>

<p>People get up-in-arms about things that hipsters give completely new names to. Oh, so did you want a new name for it... or did you want to complain about how you can't keep 'kombucha' and 'kefir' straight or how to pronounce them? </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Ok, fine, don't call it that</h4>

<p>No one is forcing you to call it a 'veggie burger'.  Call it a "black bean patty" if you want or whatever would work for you if you hate that specifying that it comes from vegetables is part of the adjective. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. That's how adjectives work</h4>

<p>Whoa whoa whoa, why are you calling it 'peanut butter' or a 'potato salad'? Peanut butter isn't butter and potato salad isn't a salad. After all, "Make a new sound with your mouth". This is selective outrage in the absence of an argument.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Semantics are not an ethical argument</h4>

<p>Call whatever you want whatever name you want, it doesn't change any of the ethical arguments at all.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="prochoice.html">VH200</a>: You can't be vegan and pro-choice</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that vegans are hypocritical in both claiming to be against the taking of life (animals) and being for the taking of life (abortion).</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. This is a strawman of the vegan position</h4>

<p>This is in line with the <a href="plants.html">plants feel pain</a>, i.e. that vegans are for blanket 'preservation of life'. Whether that's a bacterium or a human, it's all the same.  The actual point that vegans make is about reducing animal and human suffering, and increasing human and animal wellbeing.  It's just just about not 'taking a life'.  Taking a life is only meaningful in a state wherein killing you diminishes your wellbeing and hurts you.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. The actual facts disagree</h4>

<p><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2019/04/raw-data-abortions-by-week-of-pregnancy/">Most abortions are within 7 weeks of pregancy</a>, which is <a href="https://www.verywellfamily.com/when-does-implantation-occur-in-pregnancy-2371533">within a month of implantation</a>. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19092726/">It's not even clear</a> that the corteces that might be regarded as consciousness develop until quite a few months later into the pregnancy.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. This political issue doesn't exist in a vacuum</h4>

<p>Political issues are hard.  Religious zealots press hard to make abortion illegal even in medical emergencies, and therefore the shove comes back in the other direction to fight tooth and claw for every week of pregnancy, because liberals see even a slight decrease in the window is a gateway to total illegality.  Moderation or intelligent discourse in this context is a stupid idea because you just get run over.  </p>

<p>So regardless of the ethical calculus, people are willing to make moral consessions that lack the clear thinking that they otherwise might not make if not poisoned by this kind of discourse. I'm not defending it, just simply saying it's a layer of complications on the first two premises of "vegans tend to be [political category]; [political category] people support X; X is not compatible with veganism; therefore vegans are hypocrites."</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. It's a <em>tu quoque</em> fallacy.</h4>

<p>Animal agriculture still hurts people, the environment, animals, and the people consuming animal products themselves. If you think that vegans should also ditch being pro-choice, then that's a great perspective and deserves argument! But that doesn't invalidate the original argument. Carnism still hurts people, the environment, animals, and yourself, the only thing is you've stated some fact that isn't related to countering any of those arguments, just related to the people making them.  But those conclusions still stand on their own merit.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="imperfect.html">VI100</a>: You can't be 100% vegan because you kill animals by accident in modern society</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>Examples:
- "why bother going vegan when you can't go 100% vegan, you're still going to hurt animals"
- "you kill 'some animals' by accident on roads, so why not kill just 'some animals' as part of a half measure like Meatless Mondays"</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's not comparable</h4>

<p>For instance, the fact that there's a literal 1 in a million chance that you'll hit a <a href="https://www.thepetstech.com/blogs/the-pets-lounge/14446241-over-6-000-000-dogs-cats-were-killed-on-us-roads-last-year">cat or dog</a> for <a href="https://www.thezebra.com/resources/driving/average-miles-driven-per-year/#average-miles-driven-per-year-by-state">every mile you drive</a> - if you're as inattentive as the average American driver - doesn't mean that driving itself is somehow a non-vegan activity, or that if you're engaged in driving you're now not a 100% vegan. The difference between intentionally killing an animal such a gulf in magnitude that it isn't even comparable on the same scale. 6-order-of-magnitude scales matter in ethics. It's the difference between emptying out the take-a-penny-leave-a-penny at the local convenience store and burning the whole building down.  Scale matters.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. There's a difference in intentiality</h4>

<p>If you reject utilitarianism in favor of deontology, you'll have to admit there's a difference between accident and doing things with intentionality.  You can't justify aiming for a dog in the street with your car by claiming same might have also happened by accident. There still is fault in deliberately increasing those odds.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Driving doesn't meet the criteria</h4>

<p>If you reject deontology in favor of utilitarianism, then we need to weight the amount of wellbeing increased vs the cost of the suffering of some action.  Killing an animal for your temporary entertainment is a huge shift to the negative. Driving, depending on where you're going, is an extremely low probability of animals dying and an extremely high probability that you'll use the opportunity for transport to do some good in the world.  You and everyone around you would pay a massive wellbeing cost.  Or at least don't do some evil.  </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Against something on ethical grounds? Great, don't do that.</h4>

<p>If you really are bothered by the fact that you might run over an animal with your car, then don't drive. If you're really afraid that <a href="harvesting.html">any agriculture kills animals</a> then grow your own food.  </p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="harvesting.html">VI101</a>: animals die in crop harvesting</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea here is that the act of harvesting plants kills animals by:
- harvesting masceration
- pest removal
- contributing to animal agriculture by the use of animal products such as fertilizer</p>

<p>And therefore eating vegan is not actually vegan.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Carnists blow combine masceration out of proportion</h4>

<p>When you mow your lawn are there corpses of animals spewed out of the side of your lawnmower? No? Even though you sometimes see critters running along your back yard? Animals also hate being near harvested fields because there is little cover in those situations.  This isn't some densely populated forest teaming with life. Yet in every discussion carnists make it sound like behind the combine it looks like the opening scene to Saving Private Ryan.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Animals are killed because of carnism</h4>

<p>Yes, animals are not held in high regard and therefore there is no effort to keep animals out of fields, no will to improve mass harvesting technology. Because we need to grow so much food in order to feed to animals, animals are pushed out of their natural ecosystems and they are killed to keep them out of this massive agricultural territory. We also have an abundance of animal-based fertilizer because of meat production, which would not exist if not for carnism. This is all an argument for <em>more</em> veganism. The more we normalize being against animal cruelty the more these problems get fixed.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. If you didn't eat animals you'd still cause less harm</h4>

<p>Eating 1000 calories of chicken still causes <a href="http://www.animalvisuals.org/projects/data/1mc">more than two orders of magnitude more deaths</a> than grains, again, given our current technology and general lack of regard for animals and general will to reduce that number.  <a href="imperfect.html">All of these arguments</a> therefore apply.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="plants.html">VI200</a>: Vegans kill plants</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that eating animals is justified because killing plants still represents taking a life.  Alternatively, plants release chemicals when cut and therefore know they've been cut, and therefore are suffering somehow.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. That's a straw man argument</h4>

<p>The vegan position only has anything to do with 'taking a life' inasmuch as it has to do with suffering and wellbeing of conscious creatures.  Animals are conscious and can feel pain.  Plants are not and cannot.  They have no nervous system and therefore we have no moral obligation towards them, because we can't impose needless suffering on them.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Signals are not consciousness</h4>

<p>My doorbell rings when someone presses it.  Does that mean that my doorbell 'knows' someone is at the door?  No, it's an automated response, which is not an argument for moral obligations towards doorbells.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Carnism still would take more life</h4>

<p>You lose an energy factor of about 10 when you eat the animal that eats food than eating the food itself.  So even if the previous arguments didn't hold, you'd still be looking at a much higher death toll from animal products than plants.  You should still go vegan.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Carnists don't sincerely believe their own claim</h4>

<p>Why is <a href="https://www.dominionmovement.com/watch">Dominion</a> so hard to watch but mowing the lawn isn't? This argument is ridiculous.  You're seriously saying that you watch an animal get violently stabbed to death struggling in fear and are unable to make a clear distinction where that ends and picking a flower and handing it to someone begins? "Nope, pretty much the same in my book". Get out of here.</p>

<p>The carnist claims that vaccines (or any medicine) contains animal products or are tested on animals and therefore are not vegan, and vegans that consume such products are therefore hypocritical.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Lack of alternatives</h4>

<p>Veganism is engaged in harm reduction where possible.  If it's not possible then there's no choice to make.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. This is an argument for <em>more</em> veganism</h4>

<p>If anything, such arguments should be interpreted as a call for more veganism. That is, we need to create a quorum to push animal cruelty out of the market of medicine altogether. The point is that this is needless harm to animals.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. This doesn't satisfy the requirements that meat does</h4>

<p>The principle reasons to be against carnism is that it causes harm to conscious beings that don't deserve it, it causes ecological damage that hurts other people, and it hurts yourself.  Vaccines barely satisfy one out of the three, (and only then if you take a hard deontological view): they, in general, help reduce infection amongst immunocompromised people and reduce the harm to them from disease.  So they are a means of suffering reduction, they don't have significant volumes to make a substantial ecological impact (one jab a year from a fraction of an egg vs eating a whole animal each meal), and they protect you against disease.  So, even while containing animal products, it satisfies none (or kind of, barely, but not really, one) of the arguments that vegans make against carnism.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. This is a tu quoque.</h4>

<p>Just because someone else does something unethical does not justify your unethical action.  Pointing to vegans as hypocritical for engaging in some behavior doesn't actually demonstrate a coherent argument against veganism.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. "I can't live without X" doesn't apply to non-X</h4>

<p>Ok great, then go vegan except for X. "Vaccines contain animal products" and you getting a once-a-year jab isn't justification for why you're still eating cheeseburgers daily.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="everybody.html">VP100</a>: The whole world won't go vegan</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that going vegan won't change anything because not enough people will go vegan, and that one person won't make a difference.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Which is it?</h4>

<p>Carnists also claim that you shouldn't go around trying to convince too many people. So which is it? Should you be a pushy vegan trying to convince people to join or should you not? Both these arguments are just filibustering with bad arguments.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. It's just not true.</h4>

<p>Every small increment of demand is one less tortured animal. If you purchase an animal product, it echoes up the supply chain and results in animals needlessly dying.  If there is one less bag of frozen chicken bought, then the order of a box of frozen chicken bags is pushed back by one bag.  Then the production line is shut down one box earlier. Then one box's worth of chickens don't get trucked to the facility.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. There are knock-on effects</h4>

<p>Every single person going vegan absolutely makes a difference.  Every vegan normalizes the position that needlessly torturing animals for your entertainment is wrong, and every carnist is giving other carnists around them tacit approval.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. It's also not true on the global scale</h4>

<p>This isn't an all-or-nothing game, every percent of people going vegan makes an incremental difference in third-world hunger. If 1% more people go vegan, that is just that much less damage done to other people.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. We don't use this justification anywhere else</h4>

<p>We don't say "well, me not stealing this car won't make a dent in the stolen car market, so do it or not, I dunno I guess it doesn't make a difference."  or "I mean so many people are murdered each year in the world, so murder or not, it doesn't make a difference".  If something is wrong, then it's wrong, and this moral nihilism of overbearing statistics is just not relevant.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="normal.html">VP200</a>: Carnism is normal because it is popular</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea here is that eating meat is normal and you're weird if you don't.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. This isn't an ethical argument</h4>

<p>The fact that most people engage in unethical behavior should be justification for yourself.  I'm not judgemental about it; I understand it's culturally ingrained and no one has really thought about it at all.  But that's not an ethical argument for doing it.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. A lot of popular ideas were bad</h4>

<p>Try to think of a time in history when discrimination against members of other groups, whether by sexual orientation, gender, or race, may have been commonplace.  Was it ok then? Is it ok that we continue the discrimination based on species?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. It's not that weird that it's unusual</h4>

<p>People go to grocery stores and pick up neatly cling-film-wrapped packages of squiggly red playdough that turns brown on the stovetop; it's totally disconnected from the actual thing.  <a href="https://fs.blog/dan-ariely-on-why-and-how-we-cheat/">Studies</a> show that this small disconnect leads to huge implications on what people are interested in tolerating in terms of unethical behavior. Combine that with eating meat being the path of least resistence and the tacit approval of all those around you and it's not that surprising.  We'll change that, don't worry. </p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="exvegans.html">VP300</a>: There are more ex-vegans than vegans</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here points to some vaguely worded surveys from social media sites as proof that veganism is not long-term sustainable at the top of their 'evidence-based copypasta'.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Online surveys for health issues</h4>

<p>So this is the line-one item for 'anti-vegans'.  Their main piece of evidence regarding veganism and health is an uncontrolled, self-reported, vaguely worded questionnaire spread over social media with no verification of participants, controls for placebo, etc.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. How 'Veganism' is vaguely worded in the survey</h4>

<p>I tried a vegan diet one summer before returning to vegetarianism (before I became a full-time vegan).   Did that make me an ex-vegan?  I mean I didn't do it for ethical reasons. Did the people that cited 'boredom with veganism' as reason to leave actually suddenly decide "I'm bored avoiding animal cruelty"? It makes no sense. It means veganism wasn't well defined for the study.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. It just disagrees with observed reality.</h4>

<p>Why are there so many plant-based products on shelves and fast food joints providing vegan options?  Are they just spending money making food that no one buys?  That doesn't make sense.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Who cares?</h4>

<p>Who cares if there are 10, 100, or a million times as many ex-vegans than vegans. If it stands on moral groudns then it stands on moral grounds, and if you can do it you therefore should.  Who cares what other people are doing?</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="vegansaid.html">VQ100</a>: Vegan personality or organization X said or did thing Y.  Doesn't that mean eating animals is ok?</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Answer:</h2>

<p>No.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="definition.html">VQ200</a>: Veganism has no rigid definition</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here claims that veganism has no real definition that everyone can agree on that excludes everything it needs to and includes everything it does</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Wait, I thought we were a cult!</h4>

<p>Hold on, so is <a href="cult.html">veganism a cult</a> where people walk in lock step to the beat of a single drum or is it vague and definitionless? Sounds more like carnists are tripping over themselves to come up with reasons to avoid accountability.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. This applies to literally anything</h4>

<p>Name a single noun or adjective that has an undisputed definition.  Take even the color red.  Is scarlet or crimson 'red' or are they their own colors?  At what hue does red end or magenta begin?  Is pure red (#FF0000) the old real red and anything else off-red?  Is 'light red' really red or not? 'Red' is a silly example but it's in front of me because I'm building this web page. But take literally anything anywhere at any given time.  Even like 'chair' or 'table' or 'computer' have definitions which not only change with time but any dispute amongst the defintions doesn't matter with regard to the ethical considerations of the action.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Who cares?</h4>

<p>'Vegan' is just a label of ethics we attach to other people or products as a shortcut to whatever more specific definition you like.  So who cares about the semantics of what label you put on what? The goal shouldn't be to attach a label. The goal is reducing needless animal and human suffering.  </p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="cult.html">VQ201</a>: Veganism is a cult</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist claims that eating animals is ok because veganism is a cult</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Which is it?</h4>

<p>Carnists also claim that <a href="definition.html">veganism has no rigid definition</a>.  So which is it: is it a cult where all members walk in lock step or is it a vague mass with no defined edge? Answer: whatever suits the narrative I guess.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. It's actually not</h4>

<p>In this context cult is never given a serious definition; it's just thrown out as a meaningless insult.  Be that as it may, veganism has no leaders, no financial hierarchy, no enforceable rules, no restriction on coming and going, no restriction on contact with the outside world, and isn't even a single organization with no campus, no founder, and can exist as a single individual living on a desert island as carnists like to point out.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Let's be generous</h4>

<p>The best you can say is 'veganism is a meme' (using the proper Dawkins definition of 'meme'), which lacks any real bite.  But I think most vegans would agree with this definition anyways, because, yes, veganism is an idea that spreads from person to person as people become convinced of the arguments that support it. And if this website is any testament to it, veganism is a contagious idea because the ideas that support it are good. The problem is that the arguments against it are of poor quality and easily debunked.  There's just so many of them.  So many.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. What does that even have to do with anything?</h4>

<p>Ok, let's even assume that 'veganism is a cult' is even a meaningful sentence. Does that mean that you now have <em>carte blanche</em> to kill and torture animals? No, that does not logically follow.  Plenty of real cults abolish drug use.  Does that mean that doing recreational heroin is now ok?  Even if veganism were a 'stopped clock', it could still be right twice a day.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="hitler.html">VQ300</a>: Hitler was a vegetarian</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist attempts to discredit veganism by claiming Hitler was a vegetarian</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Vegetarianism has nothing to do with veganism</h4>

<p>Veganism, in general, requires abstaining from all animal products. Vegetarianism is about cutting out some animal products (he also quit drinking and smoking).  So you might as well have told me he was allergic to egg.  Great.  That literally does not matter.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Care towards conscious beings?</h4>

<p>Quick question: does imprisoning and torturing conscious beings on the basis that they are of a different taxonomic classification than you sound more like carnism or veganism?  I don't know, I guess you might want to ask <a href="holocaust.html">holocaust survivors</a>.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. You know who else breathed oxygen...? Hitler!</h4>

<p>This is a never-ending pit of nonsensical arguments.  You know who else had a never-ending pit of nonsensical arguments...? Ugh. </p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="incredulity.html">VQ400</a>: No one is really vegan</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea here is that no one could actually be vegan, so vegans must be faking it</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Just because you're weak-willed doesn't mean everyone else is</h4>

<p>git gud.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="self-superiority.html">VQ401</a>: Vegans just want to feel self-superiority because they abstain from something good</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea is that vegans just want to abstain from something good for its own sake and feel good about that</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Well....</h4>

<p>That's wrong because eating this 'good stuff' hurts animals, people, the environment, and yourself. If this website is any testament, The counterarguments to these claims are feeble and easily debunked.  There's just so many bad ones out there.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="judgemental.html">VQ402</a>: Vegans are judgemental</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that veganism isn't worth joining because vegans are judgemental</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. This is tacit approval of the vegan position</h4>

<p>You accidentally proved yourself wrong if you make this argument. If you had reasons to be against veganism, then you'd say it.  But you can't simultaneously say "I'm mad at you for your attitude towards my unethical choices" and "They aren't unethical".  Either carnism is ethical or it's not.  If it is, then you wouldn't say this, you'd say 'Vegans are wrong', not 'vegans are judgmeental', and if it is unethical, then you're agreeing with the vegans. But you can't have your cake and eat it too.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Fine. Make ethical choices and don't use the label vegan</h4>

<p>If you want to make ethical choices make them, no one is forcing you to use the label vegan if you feel like you're forced into joining some club. You just happen to be a person that boycotts the use of animal products but doesn't use any labels. And anyway, labels are just linguistic shortcuts that make it so you don't need to reexplain everything each time.  If you don't want to use one, that's on you.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. The reason to accept an argument is the strength of its premises</h4>

<p>Not some imagined motivation of the arguers. The reason to ditch carnism is because it hurts animals, humans, the environment, and yourself. Anything else is white noise.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="diet.html">VQ500</a>: Veganism is just a diet</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>Here the carnist is engaged in minimization. "Now's not the time to soapbox about some weird diet you're on"</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Whoa whoa whoa</h4>

<p>Why are you so up-in-arms about veganism? I mean if someone posted about left-handed guitars or something on a video about environmentalism, everyone would be confused about the connection.  You don't seem confused, but instead you're angry, like there's some connection you don't want to admit.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. It's not just a diet</h4>

<p>It's an ethical position, and the majority source of people's animal cruelty is their diet.  You can eat plant-based and do dogfighting. That doesn't make you a vegan.  Therefore it's not just a dietary preference.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Think of it this way</h4>

<p>When someone hands you a vegan menu at a non-vegan restaurant, they're saying 'this is the list of things that doesnt gratuitously kill animals'.  It's not a vegan menu; it's a menu compatible with veganism.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="dontcare.html">XA100</a>: "I don't care"</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Why this argument can't be defeated</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. You can just repeat that line over and over</h4>

<p>"I don't care".  Ok, eating meat hurts animals, hurts yourself, hurts other people, hurts the environment.  "I don't care".  Here's more reasons you should care. "Well I don't".  Ok, what do you say next? Probably something that will land you on <a href="adhominem.html">this page</a>.</p>

<h1 class="pt-3">Claim <a href="godsaid.html">XA200</a>: "God told me personally that [thing everyone agrees on] is wrong, but eating animals is ok."</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Why this argument can't be defeated</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's totally unfalsifiable</h4>

<p>If you just claim some personal revelation, then there's literally nothing that can defeat this argument because personal revelation is indisputable.  It's not evidence for anything, sure, but it also is impossible to argue against. </p>
