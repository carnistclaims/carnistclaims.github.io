<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: "What if you had to kill an animal out of necessity to feed your family?!"</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>Millenial Millie presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScbeMdYkKDc">more or less this argument</a> to Earthling Ed as justification for animal agriculture. This has various forms.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. That doesn't apply here</h4>

<p>This has literally nothing to do with the optional killing of animals for your own entertainment. Have you ever been in a situation in your life where you have had to kill and eat an animal and feed to it a love one or else you would starve.  Let me answer that for you, no you have not. So let's get back to reality.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Stupid arguments deserve stupid answers</h4>

<p>The funniest answer is just "Why would I kill an animal when I can pick up a vegan pizza from a place 5 minutes from my house".  "Ok but I mean what if you were on a desert island?".  "Oh then I would wait until the director yelled 'cut' and we were done filming <em>then</em> order them something to eat from my phone.". "No I mean you're not acting in a movie." "Oh am I then in a TV show?... because there's a lot of vegan joints in southern California...". And just disingenuously head for the door in any thought experiment.  They put you on a glacier with only a seal to eat? Screw it, you put aliens in a flying saucer there with you. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. This is just another example of carnist axiomaticism with hypothetical necessity as the criterion</h4>

<p><a href="subjective.html">And therefore all of the same problems apply</a>.</p>
