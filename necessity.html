<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: "What if you had to kill an animal out of necessity to feed your family?!"</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>Millennial Millie presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScbeMdYkKDc">more or less this argument</a> to Earthling Ed as justification for animal agriculture, but this sort of argument is presented repeatedly in some imagined scenario </p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. That doesn't apply here</h4>

<p>This has nothing to do with the optional killing of animals for your own entertainment. The question is: have <em>you</em> ever been in a situation in your life where you have had to kill and eat an animal and feed to it a loved one or else you would starve? If you're not in that scenario, then this argument doesn't apply.  </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. This is just another example of carnist presuppositionalism</h4>

<p>This position is that necessity in some hypothetical scenario justifies anything once that necessity is gone.  But the first killing in self-defense doesn't justify all killing all the time, so this argument just isn't a cogent defense. We have no problem identifying the problems with an argument like this in any other context "Oh sorry I stole your car for a joyride... but you know, I could have been driving someone to the hospital in some strange parallel universe. What about that? Did you think of that?!". It's comical when the same framing is used in a context that isn't as easy and convenient.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Side note: stupid arguments deserve stupid answers</h4>

<p>The funniest answer is just "Why would I kill an animal when I can pick up a vegan pizza from a place 5 minutes from my house".  "Ok, but, I mean what if you were on a desert island?".  "Oh then I would wait until the director yelled "cut" and we were done filming <em>then</em> order them something to eat from my phone.". "No I mean you're not acting in a movie." "Oh am I then in a TV show?... because there are a lot of vegan joints in southern California where those are usually filmed...". </p>

<p>Just disingenuously head for the door in any thought experiment.  Did they put you on a glacier with only a seal to eat? Screw it, you put aliens in a flying saucer there with you. </p>
