<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Being vegan is a priviledge of modernity</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that it's unreasonable to expect everyone to go vegan, especially if they live in poor communities or third-world countries where food deserts or lack of choices exist</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Is this you?</h4>

<p>If you're reading this, you're probably on the internet looking at an LED screen on a ~$1000 electronic device. You know how to read and write, and you definitely have the priviledge of modernity.  So what's <strong>your</strong> excuse?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. By eating meat you're denying modernity to others</h4>

<p>Third world countries continue to struggle and widespread meat-caused global food shortages simply do not help.  By eating meat, you are helping ensure that the ceiling is as low as possible crushing down on the people you supposedly care so much about.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. It's just not true</h4>

<p>"Beans and rice" is synonymous with cheap living.  If you actually list off other 'cheap foods' they are all vegan, like lentils, soybeans, or wheat.  If you're concerned with third-world countries, just consider places like Koh Phangan in Thailand which is described as 'vegan paradise', or Israel, which has a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2133401583575593">completely vegan city</a>.  Plenty of other 'third world' countries regularly make lists for places for vegans to visit, like <a href="https://www.happycow.net/vegtopics/travel/top-vegan-friendly-cities">Ho Chi Minh City</a>. So it's vaguely true at best.  In most of these places, the critical missing component isn't the actual food, it's just widespread ignorance and entrenched cultural beliefs.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. This is not an argument against veganism</h4>

<p>It's an argument against vegans being 'judgemental'. But that's already just <a href="judgemental.html">a carnist stereotype</a> of vegans. This is just another claim intended to stigmatize veganism in order to deflect responsibility.</p>
