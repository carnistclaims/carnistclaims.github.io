<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Vegans kill animals by accident in modern society</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>Vegans kill 'some animals' by accident on roads, so why not kill just 'some animals' as part of a half measure like Meatless Mondays?</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's not comparable</h4>

<p>For instance, the fact that there's a literal 1 in a million chance that you'll hit a <a href="https://www.thepetstech.com/blogs/the-pets-lounge/14446241-over-6-000-000-dogs-cats-were-killed-on-us-roads-last-year">cat or dog</a> for <a href="https://www.thezebra.com/resources/driving/average-miles-driven-per-year/#average-miles-driven-per-year-by-state">every mile you drive</a> - if you're as inattentive as the average American driver - doesn't mean that driving itself is somehow a non-vegan activity, or that if you're engaged in driving you're now not a 100% vegan. The difference between intentionally killing an animal such a gulf in magnitude that it isn't even comparable on the same scale. 6-order-of-magnitude scales matter in ethics. It's the difference between emptying out the take-a-penny-leave-a-penny at the local convenience store and burning the whole building down.  Scale matters.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. It's a bad argument under any ethical system</h4>

<p>Let's consider the ethical systems of deontology (i.e. that moral imperatives towards the subject are what you need to consider in order for an action to be considered ethical) and utilitarianism (i.e. that the maximum possible well-being is to be aimed for in order to be considered ethical):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>If you accept deontology:</strong> you'll have to admit there's a difference between accident and doing things with intentionality.  You can't justify aiming for a dog in the street with your car by claiming same might have also happened by accident. There still is fault in deliberately increasing those odds.</li>
<li><strong>If you accept utilitarianism:</strong> then we need to weight the amount of well-being increased vs the cost of the suffering of some action.  Killing an animal for your temporary entertainment is a huge shift to the negative. Driving, depending on where you're going, is an extremely low probability of animals dying and an extremely high probability that you'll use the opportunity for transport to do some good in the world.  You and everyone around you would pay a massive well-being cost.  Or at least don't do some evil.  </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Against something on ethical grounds? Great, don't do that.</h4>

<p>If you really are bothered by the fact that you might run over an animal with your car, then don't drive. If you're really afraid that <a href="harvesting.html">any agriculture kills animals</a> then grow your own food.  You can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time. The idea that you might cause some smaller harm X isn't a good argument for preventing yourself from causing some greater harm Y.</p>
