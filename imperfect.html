<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Vegans kill animals by accident in modern society</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>Vegans kill "some animals" by accident on roads, so why not kill just "some animals" as part of a half measure like Meatless Mondays?</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's not comparable</h4>

<p>For instance, the fact that there's a literal 1 in a million chance that you'll hit a <a href="https://www.thepetstech.com/blogs/the-pets-lounge/14446241-over-6-000-000-dogs-cats-were-killed-on-us-roads-last-year">cat or dog</a> for <a href="https://www.thezebra.com/resources/driving/average-miles-driven-per-year/#average-miles-driven-per-year-by-state">every mile you drive</a> - if you're as inattentive as the average American driver - doesn't mean that driving itself is somehow a non-vegan activity, or that if you're engaged in driving you're now not a 100% vegan. The difference between intentionally killing an animal such a gulf in magnitude that it isn't even comparable on the same scale. 6-order-of-magnitude scales matter in ethics. It's the difference between emptying out the take-a-penny-leave-a-penny at the local convenience store and burning the whole building down.  Scale matters.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. It's a bad argument under any ethical system</h4>

<p>Let's consider the two major schools of thought in ethics: 1. deontology (i.e. that moral imperatives towards the subject are what you need to consider in order for an action to be considered ethical) and 2. utilitarianism (i.e. that the maximum possible well-being is to be aimed for in order to be considered ethical):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>If you accept deontology:</strong> you'll have to admit there's a difference between accident and doing things with intentionality.  You can't justify aiming for a dog in the street with your car by claiming same might have also happened by accident. There still is fault in deliberately increasing those odds.  Therefore, carnism violates your ethical obligations towards those beings regardless. </li>
<li><strong>If you accept utilitarianism:</strong> then we need to weight the amount of well-being increased vs the cost of the suffering of some action.  Killing an animal for your temporary entertainment is a huge shift to the negative - you gain some slight sensory benefit over eating something you don't like as much, but the animal pays for that difference with its suffering and life. On the other hand, driving is an activity with an extremely low probability of animals dying and an extremely high probability that you'll use the opportunity for transport to do some good in the world.  You and everyone around you would pay a massive well-being cost. So again, carnism remains unethical.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. This really is just refusing accountability</h4>

<p>Taken to its logical conclusion, this is just a position that if some background number of animals die, whether in harvesters, on the roads, or whatever, then there's no point in ever taking any accountability towards attempting to reduce that number even if it's by a huge amount by doing very little.  That means if a single animal ever dies by human cause ever, you can always just throw up your hands and say "Welp, <em>we</em> couldn't protect that one animal, now that means that I get to dig into these chicken wings", which just sloughs off responsibility and <a href="nihilism.html">is not a reasonable position</a>, because now almost anything is justified.  "Can't stop all theft? Theft is now moral."  It's not a coherent ethical principle.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Overhauling everything isn't comparable to small changes</h4>

<p>Ultimately this argument is saying that between the following actions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Saving the lives of hundreds of animals by just ordering something else off the menu... and</li>
<li>Overhauling your entire life such that you ensure that a single animal never comes to harm due to your existence ever</li>
</ol>

<p>Because you aren't willing or don't think it's possible to do Action 2, then it's ok to skip over Action 1 and white-washes the ethics of your unwillingness to change.  By that logic, for instance, if you need to drive a car... and since you can never ensure that you won't cause a fatal accident while doing so (Action 2), that means that now human murder is ethical (Action 1).  This isn't a coherent system of ethics.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. Against something on ethical grounds? Great, don't do that.</h4>

<p>If you really are bothered by the fact that you might run over an animal with your car, then don't drive. If you're really afraid that <a href="harvesting.html">any agriculture kills animals</a> then grow your own food.  You can walk and chew bubblegum at the same time. The idea that you might cause some smaller harm X isn't a good argument for preventing yourself from causing some greater harm Y.</p>
