<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: We have been eating meat for thousands of years</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist claims that eating meat is somehow to be grandfathered in as though it is now ethical, simply because it was necessary in the past.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Which is it?</h4>

<p>It seems unusual to make the claim that it <em>was</em> necessary if one believes that it currently <em>is</em> necessary.  If you believed both, you would simply state the latter, so carnists making the former argument cannot be common with the carnists making the latter.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. It is objectively untrue</h4>

<p>The idea that it was necessary is a baseless assertion to start (e.g. Jainism has existed for hundreds of years which teaches non-violence towards animals). But let's assume that it indeed was necessary to kill some amount of animals or use their products.  One cannot extend that claim to include factory farming.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. We don't accept this argument in any other context</h4>

<p>People have been doing a lot of things for a long time, including slavery, murder, theft and torture.  That doesn't just give one freedom from ethical responsibility in a modern context. This is just cherry picking.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. This is based on an idealized fiction</h4>

<p>This is based on some kind of idealized parallel universe, which can't possibly include McDonald's Drive Thru, which has not existed for thousands of years.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. This doesn't address the issue</h4>

<p>The issue is that it's unethical to abuse animals for your entertainment under <a href="justified.html">any ethical system</a>. You can't counter that with "yeah but it's been going on for thousands of years".  Ok, great, well it's still unethical to abuse animals for your entertainment, and you've stated an irrelevant fact.</p>
