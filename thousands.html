<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: We have been eating meat for thousands of years</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist claims that eating meat is somehow to be grandfathered in as though it is now ethical, simply because it was necessary in the past.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It wasn't necessary in the past</h4>

<p>The idea that it was necessary is a baseless assertion to start (e.g. Jains exist and have for hundreds of years but don't believe in violence towards animals). But let's assume that it indeed was.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Times change</h4>

<p>Do you walk everywhere you need to go or take a draft animal?  No, you get in a car or bus - which is kind of like the old thing we used to do... but it has been changed and modernized. It's interesting how the only thing we hold on tightly to is the easiest thing. So you are willing to trade smoke signals for cell phones and vehicles for donkeys, but you aren't willing to trade vegan food for one that causes significantly more suffering.  Interesting choices indeed.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. You can justify literally anything like this</h4>

<p>People have been doing a lot of things for a long time, including slavery, murder, theft and torture. After all, you had to preemptively kill that other guy before he potentially killed you, just like you needed to kill that animal before you potentially ran out of food.  That doesn't just give you freedom from ethical responsibility if you do that in a modern context.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. This doesn't address the argument</h4>

<p>The argument is that it's unethical to abuse animals for your entertainment under <a href="justified.html">any ethical system</a>. You can't counter that with "yeah but it's been going on for thousands of years".  Ok, great, well it's still unethical to abuse animals for your entertainment, and you've stated an irrelevant fact.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Verdict</h2>

<p>Doing something for a long time doesn't magically make it ethical.</p>
