<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Animals don't understand morality</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claims are variously stated:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you look out in nature, animals kill each other and have no moral qualm about it, so why should we?</li>
<li>Animals don't understand morality, and therefore we have no moral obligation towards them</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Moral agency isn't a requirement for being the subject of moral obligations</h4>

<p>If it were, then we would say that we have no moral obligation towards the mentally disabled or small children.  Clearly we do.  This isn't about the animal's moral obligations towards us; it's about our moral obligation towards the animals.  Obviously, we can't hold a shark 'accountable' for biting a human, but we should definitely hold a human accountable for killing sharks needlessly by the thousands.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. We don't use someone else's ethics in determining our own actions</h4>

<p>A toddler will walk up to other kids and randomly take things from their hands, because they don't understand social norms. Ok cool, so any time a toddler is holding something, it's fair game for me to take! Wait... that doesn't morally follow. Am I allowed to assault the mentally handicapped or people with dementia because they might hit me? No, of course not. So, given that we never use someone else's morality for our own, why do we justify it in this one particular instance?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Most 'food' animals don't kill other animals</h4>

<p>Most animals we eat are typically prey animals and not predators. All the classic farm animals are herbivores, as well as deer, quail, and almost all other commonly hunted animals. The fact that an obligate-carnivore predator kills prey 'without regard' (whatever that means - did we survey lions or something?) doesn't really apply to you also killing the prey. If anything, shouldn't it be the opposite - I mean, do you regularly envision yourself jumping in when you see someone kicking the crap out of a frail person to help the assailant?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Most 'natural conditions' are obligate carnivorous conditions</h4>

<p>If you are reading this, you are not an obligate carnivore, and therefore the actions of an animal that does something out of necessity (or an omnivorous animal who doesn't know where its next meal is coming from) doesn't apply to you doing something unnecessary with your grocery pickup where neat packages of ground beef are placed in the trunk of your car at the click of a button. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. People understand Morality</h4>

<p>...and eating meat hurts other people, for instance, in countries where food scarce due to it being exported to feed 'food' animals, or in the form of climate change. So that can't be your justification.</p>
