<h2 class="pt-3">Why this argument can't be defeated</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's totally unfalsifiable</h4>

<p>If you just claim some personal revelation, then there's literally nothing that can defeat this argument because personal revelation is indisputable.  It's not evidence for anything, sure, but it also is impossible to argue against. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. What would you say?</h4>

<p>Out of curiosity, assume that someone was going to kill you and claimed that God had told them personally that killing you was ok.  What would you say to that person at that moment?  Perhaps you ought to consider telling yourself that once the roles are reversed.</p>
