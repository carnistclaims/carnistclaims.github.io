<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Humans are the top of the food chain</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>Carnists claim that humans are justified in eating meat because it is their natural place within ecology to do so.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. The food chain isn't real</h4>

<p>The concept of a food chain is an invention that helps schoolchildren understand basic ecology.  It is too simplified to even be useful in biology, such as in cases where two species (usually one being invasive) predate on each other (or on each others' young), for instance, or when species eat their own young.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. This isn't your actual justification anyways</h4>

<p>Even if the food chain really existed as a real thing, is drinking other species' milk really apex-predator behavior?  Or putting a stack of neatly extruded pepperoni into a shopping cart? So, some imagined 'food chain' isn't actually why you do what you do.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. It's not even justification</h4>

<p>Even if you accept the argument that humans are part of some imagined natural ecology that somehow includes hotdogs, it does not follow that what is natural within ecology is automatically ethically justified.  Is eating the young of your own species ok because animals do it in the wild?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Self-defeating</h4>

<p>Even if you somehow ignore all these problems, meat is still an ecological disaster that also starves people in third-world countries, which serves to only destroy the very 'food chain' you're arguing for. So you can't use really use that as justification for eating meat or consuming animal products.</p>
