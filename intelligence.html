<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Eating meat helped us evolve higher intelligence</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea is that eating meat helped us in the past evolutionarily, so it is justified today.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. You're not surviving off the land on the Serengeti</h4>

<p>You can't talk about hunting animals with spears having helped us evolve to justify putting frozen bags of chicken wings in their shopping cart.  Freezers didn't exist; shopping carts didn't exist.  Furthermore, the animals you're killing now aren't the ones you would have killed back then. So, you've modified the entire narrative except for the part that's the most convenient for you. You want to pay money, which didn't exist, to have someone truck your meat in from a factory farm. None of this has anything to do with the original action in reality.  This is just nonsense.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. We don't live in the past</h4>

<p>What was ethical then isn't now. Xenophobia and tribal warfare, for instance, was a major player in keeping tribes together and affected human migration patterns that had us populate the globe, but does that give us freedom to do whatever we want to people that look different from ourselves? Of course not.  If we simply give <em>carte blanche</em> to anything which helps propagate the human race, then that would by necessity include rape and genocide.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. It doesn't actually address the argument</h4>

<p>You can't respond to the claim that "it hurts animals, other humans, the environment, and yourself when you consume animal products for your own entertainment" with "yeah, well it helped us evolve".  That is a complete non-sequitur and does not counter the argument. Carnism remains unethical for those reasons, and you've just mentioned an irrelevant fact.</p>
