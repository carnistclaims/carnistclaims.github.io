<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: "It's not people; it's big industry hurting the environment"</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea here is that it's not your personal choices which are causing climate change or fishless oceans, it's "big industry" and we need regulation to fix it.  Focusing on personal choices is a distraction from the systems we need to put in place.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's the opposite of how things work</h4>

<p><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/carbon-footprint-climate-change-personal-action-collective-action.html">History</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629621002437?dgcid=author">scientific studies</a> have shown that personal responsibility is the most effective way to create policy change and install the systems that will help.  So by doing this concern-trolling game where you don't want to take any personal responsibility, you are actually actively hurting the environmentalist movement you are pretending to care about. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvAznN_MPWQ">This vlogbrothers video is agreate summary of the topic</a> of how personal change impacts policy.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. It's not how any of this works.</h4>

<p>How humans behave aside, this is just <a href="already.html">another case</a> of people pretending to not understand how supply and demand works. Industries don't make stuff if nobody buys it. By buying it, you're creating the demand for the product and normalizing it, and contributing to the damage. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. You want to regulate a change you don't want to make</h4>

<p>So let me get this straight: You don't want to eat vegan food, you want to keep eating your ground beef or whatever. So what's the big brain idea here to reduce emissions from the single-largest source of climate change, or to stop overfishing? Legally force people to eat less meat? That's what the regulations would have to do - but then carnists would go down kicking and screaming.  So what's the actual plan here? Regulations won't make <a href="agriculture.html">beef</a> or <a href="sustainable.html">fish</a> less environmentally destructive without limiting consumption, or at least have historically failed to do so.  </p>

<p>So ultimately, there's really two options: 1. take personal responsibility now and thereby encourage the creation of policy or 2. Do nothing, complain that "systems aren't in place", and then hope that laws are magically put in place that force you to action that you didn't want to take in the first place. It seems pretty clear that this is just pushing responsibility off and pretending to care.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. The ethical implications remain</h4>

<p>You're still killing an animal that doesn't want to die for your own entertainment.  It doesn't matter if you can shove off the environmental and human impact onto someone else. </p>
