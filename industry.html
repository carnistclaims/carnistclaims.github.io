<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: "It's not people; it's big industry hurting the environment"</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea here is that it's not your personal choices which are causing climate change, it's 'big industry' and we need regulation to fix it.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's a load of crap</h4>

<p>This is another case of people <a href="already.html">pretending to not understand</a> how supply and demand work. Industries don't make stuff if nobody buys it. By buying it you're creating the demand for the product, and contributing to the collateral damage.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. You want to regulate a change you don't want to make</h4>

<p>So let me get this straight: You don't want to eat vegan food, you want to keep eating your ground beef or whatever. So what's the big brain idea here to reduce beef emissions? Legally force you to eat less meat? That's what the regulations would have to do.  But then carnists would go down kicking and screaming.  So what's the actual plan here? Regulations won't make <a href="agriculture.html">beef</a> or <a href="sustainable.html">fish</a> less environmentally destructive without limiting consumption. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. It's deflecting responsibility</h4>

<p>No, <strong>you</strong> need to take responsibility for <strong>your</strong> choices.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. The ethical implications remain</h4>

<p>You're still killing an animal that doesn't want to die for your own entertainment.  It doesn't matter if you can shove off the environmental and human impact onto someone else. </p>
