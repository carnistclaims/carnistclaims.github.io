<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Moral nihilism justifies carnism</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The argument is that so much (animal or human) suffering has gone on already (or could be going on or is going on concomitantly), one more animal won't really add any additional suffering and therefore at any given meal there's no reason to not order an animal product. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>"It would be cruel to animals already killed to stop now."</li>
<li>"At least I'm not doing X extremely wrong thing, therefore X lesser wrong thing is justified".</li>
<li><a href="capitalism.html">"There's no ethical consumption under capitalism."</a></li>
<li><a href="everybody.html">"The whole world won't go vegan, so what does it matter"</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. That is literally <em>carte blanche</em> for <strong>any action</strong> ever taken</h4>

<p>If you do anything ever and you live in a world where any significant amount of suffering ever exists, now everything ever is morally justified, because you can always deflect to that. "So many cars get stolen, what's another one?" "So many people die each year, what's another one [pulls out gun]?" or even "So many people die each year, why not steal a dollar?". This an obviously psycopathic view of the world.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Carnists don't believe their own argument towards animals</h4>

<p>Carnists claiming this also still would feel recoil in horror at taking a large knife and deformed a cute little dog for instance. "what does it matter, so many dogs have birth defects, blindness or missing limbs?  This is just another one of them now."  Carnists would still be calling for that guy's head even though they turn around and propose some version of moral nihilism as a justification for their own actions towards animals.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Everything isn't equally wrong</h4>

<p>Stealing $5, murder, buying a vegan sandwich, and throwing a baby chick alive into a shredder can't all be 'equally wrong', if the word "morality" is to mean anything. That's just absurd. You don't get away with just pooling you causing suffering in with others doing the same. This isn't a real argument.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. This is just a helper argument for carnist axiomaticism</h4>

<p>In this case, nihilism is a way to sort of launder the ethical implications of all actions so that you can then come in to axiomatically define carnism as ok. <a href="subjective.html">And therefore all of the same problems apply</a>.</p>
