<h4 class="pt-3">What is this website?</h4>

<p>This site is dedicated to finding a response to every single defense a carnist has ever put out in justification of non-veganism.  Due to the varied, multiple, unique, and creative ways that carnists justify killing animals, it's hard to track them all and you start playing argument whack-a-mole. Rather than type the same counters to the same few arguments you can say "see this page, point 3". It's mostly inspired in form by the <a href="http://talkorigins.org/indexcc/list.html">talkorigins archive</a>, which is a similar site for resources against bad pseudoscience of a different type.  </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">What is a carnist?</h4>

<p>A "Carnist" is a non-vegan. "Vegan" is a silly term, let alone negating it with "non-vegan".  We don't have terms like "non-car-thief" or "non-murderer".  If you don't engage in unethical behavior you're the default, and when you do, that deserves the label in any other context. So I'm a non-carnist, which people generally call a "vegan", and if you engage in animal agriculture, you're a carnist.  In addition, to argue that one species has rights that another doesn't is special pleading and would require justification. Again, in any other context, we recognize not special pleading as the default.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">Isn't this another listing site for veganism?</h4>

<p>Yes, there are many sites countering carnist claims, but those other sites 1. aren't attempting to catalogue them all (or at least that's not an apparent goal.) so that kind of hampers the use of the site. I want to be the end-all-be-all resource for all the arguments, rather than a partial list of major resources. 2. I'm also creating a taxonomy of these arguments, not just disparately listing them out, which helps with searching and keeping track of them 3. The more the merrier. If you like some other site, use that site; if you like mine, use mine. Check out the <a href="resources.html">resources</a> page for other sources of arguments.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">How can I support this page?</h4>

<p>At the moment there are two methods of support: 1. Just use the page whenever you're in an argument and 2. Help by suggesting edits on <a href="https://github.com/carnistclaims/carnistclaims.github.io/issues">github</a> by opening an 'issue'.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">What if your website disappears?</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/carnistclaims/carnistclaims.github.io/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">You can download a snapshot here</a>, or just save the <a href="full_list.html">full list page</a> using the source, printing or some fancy format with some browser extension.</p>
