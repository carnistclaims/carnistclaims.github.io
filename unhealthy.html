<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Person X recommended veganism but looks unhealthy</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>This somehow invalidates their claim because they need to clean up their health before they can instruct others</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Hey, now, my uncle has a medical condition.</h4>

<p>Sorry, were we allowed to make vague appeals to medical conditions? It seems like that's ok in the case of carnists claiming why they can't be vegan, but if a vegan looks unhealthy then <strong>no excuses!</strong></p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. No physiology is correct</h4>

<p>Sorry, you're too skinny to advocate for veganism, you need to be in shape.  But not in too good of shape, because then carnists will play natty police and claim that you're injecting steroids. Or, if you're someone in the middle like Vegan Gains, then I'll sit down with dozens of pictures of you and other youtubers with reported bicep measurements and at the end come to the completely objective conclusion that veganism can't build muscle. Also, if you're in shape, that doesn't mean you know anything about nutrition; it just means you're at best a stopped clock that is right twice a day. So you need credentials.  You might need an MD or you might need to be a registered dietitian or nutritionist.  Whichever you are, I'll claim it's the other one you need to be. Also, if you haven't been vegan for long enough, your physique is still attributable to carnism, and I'm sure there will be a settled number with no goalpost moving.</p>

<p>So you really need to be someone that's in shape, but not too in shape - it's very specific. They must be a nutitionist/dietitian/medical doctor, that's been vegan for "long enough" - oh and they need to be the same ethnicity and gender as the critic as well, and they must come with documented proof that they had no genetic advantage of any type, and pictures must be submitted of them in the act of eating every meal for the last 10 years to prove they've been vegan, as well as pictures at the time when they claimed they started veganism to prove that it wasn't just carry-over from carnism.</p>

<p>That's the only person I can take nutrition advice from. </p>
