<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Vegans cheat on their diet and lie about it</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea is that most vegans online lie about being vegan and therefore:</p>

<ul>
<li>Being vegan is harder than vegans make it seem</li>
<li>Being vegan is so hard on your health that people don't stay vegan</li>
<li>The number of vegans is overinflated</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Which is it?</h4>

<p>People get upset when vegans are <a href="commonground.html">overly policing</a> and <a href="judgemental.html">judgmental</a> of <a href="milkfarm.html">reduction-limited</a> ethical systems or <a href="parttime.html">part-time</a> vegans.  So which is it? Are vegans not policing the term vegan hard enough or are we too soft and need to police it harder?  Seems like it's just more attempts to filibuster with bad arguments or throw <a href="multiplicity.html">everything at the wall</a> just to see what sticks. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Which is it? (Pt. 2)</h4>

<p>Also, wait, was veganism <a href="definition.html">not rigidly defined enough</a>? So then how can you tie what people report to what they actually are?  Surely if veganism is just whatever the person says it is, then 100% of claimed vegans are actual vegans.  Or if there isn't a good enough definition, then how could you even establish such a metric to begin with?</p>

<p>If someone "more or less eats just plant-based" then are they vegan?  And if they eat animal products once a week are they quitting veganism 52 times a year?   This whole argument falls apart upon inspection.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. This sort of proves the vegan ethical argument</h4>

<p>If people want to pretend they've taken an ethical position without actually taking it, it must mean that they must think the ethical position is superior in some way. Why would someone want to pretend to be vegan if they didn't actually think that it was an ethically superior position that they couldn't hold themselves to? Would you catch a climate denier dead in a Prius, pretending to care about the environment? Probably not.  So this is more of a highlighting of the difficulty of giving up things you enjoy, weighed down under a mountain of <a href="index.html">bad arguments</a> versus what you <a href="justified.html">know to be true</a> deep down.   </p>

<p>Since these people are not vegan, they are carnists, and hence you're proving that carnists want to go vegan but have a hard time bringing themselves to it.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. People like labels</h4>

<p>There seems to be this kind of <a href="tried.html">weird phenomenon</a> where people want "to be vegan" without actually wanting to be vegan.  I'm not really sure what's up with that other than to say that if you find yourself in that camp then, you probably are just not sufficiently disabused of your excuses for eating animal products and need to <a href="https://watchdominion.org/">watch more things that deal with the harsh reality of your choices</a>.</p>
