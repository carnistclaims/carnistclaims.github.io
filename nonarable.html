<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Animals are farmed on non-arable land that cannot be used for plants</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that animal agriculture is sustainable because it uses land that otherwise would not be able to be used for growing food</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's just not true on our planet</h4>

<p>While it is theoretically possible in some alternate universe that we could be growing free-range meat on soil that otherwise is unfit for growing crops, that just isn't the case in our actual reality. <a href="https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/food_practice/sustainable_production/soy/">80% of the soy we grow</a> goes towards feeding animals. The US alone <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat">could feed 800 million people</a> with just our food supply. <a href="https://www.forksoverknives.com/wellness/animal-agriculture-hunger-and-how-to-feed-a-growing-global-population-part-one-of-two/">The sole reason for worldwide hunger</a> is that food is fed to livestock while people suffer in hunger.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Eating animal products hurts people</h4>

<p>If you are still consuming products at this point, then you are contributing to an unsustainable ecology that hurts people. The fact that it might be possible in some alternate universe that it wouldn't be the case that people die for your entertainement is irrelevent.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Hurting animals is still unethical</h4>

<p>It's impossible to get past the fact that it isn't ethical to kill something that doesn't want to die, and so there's no way to skirt that issue by claiming that "it's just so economical to hang animals upside down as they panic and put bolts through their heads and slit their throats". That is just not a response that makes any sense in any other context.  We wouldn't accept it for human slavery, and we therefore shouldn't accept it for animals.</p>
