<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: I base my morality on intelligence</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>Animals are less intelligent than humans and therefore can be slaughtered for food.  Arguments also include more specific indicators of intelligence, such as the ability to speak English or anticipate suffering.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. We don't base morality on intelligence in any other context</h4>

<p>We don't regard the mentally disabled or children with any less regard than that of an intelligent adult - in fact, we usually do exactly the opposite, our natural instinct is to defend the defenseless in any other context.  We also don't consider that a more intelligent adult should be issued hunting licenses for less intelligent adults.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. There is no objective measure of intelligence</h4>

<p>Consider we travel to another planet and meet a bunch of beings not unlike ourselves.  They are better than us at calculus, but worse at emotional intelligence, so they couldn't cooperate to build a spaceship (that meant we visited them first, rather than vice-versa). Who gets to eat whom? Or is emotional intelligence not "real intelligence"... as declared by whom?  </p>

<p>In the case of more specific indicators like language, whose language? If aliens use pheromones and body language to communicate (like insects do), then does that mean that they would get to eat us on the basis that we can't smell their pheromones or understand their movements? Or do we get to eat them on the basis that they have difficulty with some aspect of English grammar, perhaps.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. This is just a stack of arbitrary criterion</h4>

<p>If we, for instance, just draw a line at doing math, <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/animals-can-do-almost-math">then we shouldn't eat animals</a>. As a society, we also frown on the eating of golden retrievers, which are no more able to do math than other species that we don't offer any protection towards. Pigs are also generally regarded as smarter than cats, and we don't eat cats. So even on a species-by-species basis (which itself is <a href="species.html">untenable</a>) what's the real metric?  If we base it on symbolic math should we be able to eat cavemen who didn't do any of that?</p>

<p>It's already special pleading to base morality on anything other than capacity for wellbeing and suffering, it's even more arbitrary to say it's based on intelligence, i.e. on an arbitrarily chosen specific version of intelligence, and then one can sort of (again) arbitrarily pick and choose which animals we selectively apply the intelligence towards.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Collateral Human Damage</h4>

<p>By eating meat we're hurting other people in addition to animals, so this argument doesn't address that issue, which doesn't satisfy this argument's own criteria.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. This is just another example of carnist axiomaticism with "intelligence" as the criterion</h4>

<p><a href="subjective.html">And therefore all the same problems apply</a>.</p>
