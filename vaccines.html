<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Vaccines aren't vegan</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist claims that vaccines (or any medicine) contains animal products or are tested on animals and therefore are not vegan, and vegans that consume such products are therefore hypocritical.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Lack of alternatives</h4>

<p>Veganism is engaged in harm reduction where possible.  If it's not possible then there's no choice to make.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. This is an argument for <em>more</em> veganism</h4>

<p>If anything, such arguments should be interpreted as a call for more veganism. That is, we need to create a quorum to push animal cruelty out of the market of medicine altogether. The point is that this is needless harm to animals.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. This doesn't satisfy the requirements that meat does</h4>

<p>The principle reasons to be against carnism is that it causes harm to conscious beings that don't deserve it, it causes ecological damage that hurts other people, and it hurts yourself.  Vaccines barely satisfy one out of the three, (and only then if you take a hard deontological view): they, in general, help reduce infection amongst immunocompromised people and reduce the harm to them from disease.  So they are a means of suffering reduction, they don't have significant volumes to make a substantial ecological impact (one jab a year from a fraction of an egg vs eating a whole animal each meal), and they protect you against disease.  So, even while containing animal products, it satisfies none (or kind of, barely, but not really, one) of the arguments that vegans make against carnism.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. This is a tu quoque.</h4>

<p>Just because someone else does something unethical does not justify your unethical action.  Pointing to vegans as hypocritical for engaging in some behavior doesn't actually demonstrate a coherent argument against veganism.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. "I can't live without X" doesn't apply to non-X</h4>

<p>Ok great, then go vegan except for X. "Vaccines contain animal products" and you getting a once-a-year jab isn't justification for why you're still eating cheeseburgers daily.</p>
