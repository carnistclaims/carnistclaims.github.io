<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Vegans kill plants</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that eating animals is justified because killing plants still represents taking a life.  Alternatively, plants release chemicals when cut and therefore know they've been cut, and therefore are suffering somehow.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems with this Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. That's a straw man argument</h4>

<p>The vegan position only has anything to do with 'taking a life' inasmuch as it has to do with suffering and wellbeing of conscious creatures.  Animals are conscious and can feel pain.  Plants are not and cannot.  They have no nervous system and therefore we have no moral obligation towards them, because we can't impose needless suffering on them.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Signals are not consciousness</h4>

<p>My doorbell rings when someone presses it.  Does that mean that my doorbell 'knows' someone is at the door?  No, it's an automated response, which is not an argument for moral obligations towards doorbells.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Carnism still would take more life</h4>

<p>You lose an energy factor of about 10 when you eat the animal that eats food than eating the food itself.  So even if the previous arguments didn't hold, you'd still be looking at a much higher death toll from animal products than plants.  You should still go vegan.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Carnists don't sincerely believe their own claim</h4>

<p>Why is <a href="https://www.dominionmovement.com/watch">Dominion</a> so hard to watch but mowing the lawn isn't? This argument is ridiculous.  You're seriously saying that you watch an animal get violently stabbed to death struggling in fear and are unable to make a clear distinction where that ends and picking a flower and handing it to someone begins? "Nope, pretty much the same in my book". Get out of here.</p>
