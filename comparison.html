<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: I am annoyed at a vegan's comparison to X</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>This is feigned outrage as a means of avoiding the issue. E.g. towards the claim that it's morally inconsistent to have one standard for human slavery (in America) and another for animal suffering, the dodge is "Oh no, you did not just compare black people to animals!"</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems with this Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Comparing things isn't equating them</h4>

<p>Let's try this exercise: try thinking of a few similarities and differences between a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geyser">geyser</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano">volcano</a>. .... Whaaaat???!! Oh no, you did not just compare a geyser, which is an interesting feature of some random parks around the world, to a volcano, which actually kill people! Volcanoes actually destroy cities! How can you even compare the two? (I mean, except for the ways in which you just did)</p>

<p>Magnitude is just one scale along which you compare things.  You can compare a puddle and an ocean.  When you compare things you aren't saying they are equal, you're saying that they share some features.  Magnitude is just of them.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. You're missing the point</h4>

<p>The point is that you apply one standard of ethics in one area of life where things are already obviously wrong to you, and a different standard in a different area of life where it seems it's not so obvious. Yes, it's a different area, because the two things that are being compared are different things (If they were the same, there wouldn't be any point in comparing them, would there?). But what the argument that brought you to this page is trying to say is be consistent across these two different areas... that are, again, not the same thing. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. This just dodges the issue, but gives feigned moral superiority</h4>

<p>The point is that carnism hurts animals, the environment, other people, and yourself. Oh you didn't like the way a vegan said something one time?  Ok great, well, carnism still hurts animals, the environment, other people, and yourself.  You stating that you were once offended doesn't counter any of those arguments. It's stating an irrelevant fact.</p>
