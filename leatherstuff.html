<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: I have leather stuff I still want to use</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>I can't go vegan because I still own some stuff with animal products in it.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. That's fine</h4>

<p>Veganism typically focuses on not purchasing animal products, e.g. I don't buy frozen chicken from my local grocer because that means they will order a new box of frozen chicken one bag sooner, and they will, in turn, increase demand at the chicken abattoir, which will call for an additional chicken to be trucked in sooner, etc. up the supply chain.  So it really is the consumption on that level that makes the biggest difference. </p>

<p>There are smaller secondary effects, so for instance, if you know someone else that uses some particular animal product X that you also happen to have, and if you know you don't want it any more, then you might consider handing that over if it's like an unopened item of makeup or whatever.  There's also potentially advertising your use of animal products that normalizes it for others. </p>

<p>Whatever the case is, all conversions take more than zero nanoseconds, so even if you decided to go from carnist to ethical vegan overnight, you'd still have a fridge full of food, etc.  What you want to do is up to you, but no one is putting a gun to your head to make you throw it all in the trash.  If you're sufficiently disgusted by it then go ahead, but you do you.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Go vegan except for X</h4>

<p>If you really aren't convinced that you're a true vegan unless you don't use any animal products, and you still own a pair of leather shoes that you want to wear out, then great - go vegan except for those shoes you already own. If anyone asks tell them as much - you bought the shoes before you committed to veganism so it's the vestige of carnism you'll ever have.  You can even get all symbolic with it and say it's a reminder or whatever, or color them green or something. Whatever you want.  Go wild.</p>

<p>Remember that this is a marathon, not a sprint.  So if there's a moment while you're getting all that stuff out of your life, that's fine.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Verdict</h2>

<p>If you own animal products, just go vegan with regards to new things you consume.</p>
