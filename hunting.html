<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: I hunt animals as an act of mercy when they would die in the wild anyway</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that hunted meat is ethical because:
- it would be ethical for everyone to only eat meat from hunted animals and abolish animal agriculture.
- hunting is an act of mercy and that killing an animal is therefore a good thing
- carnists are controlling the overpopulation 
- the animal dies instantly rather than letting it starve out from overpopulation</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. This is rarely the actual justification</h4>

<p>Almost nobody hunts and otherwise eat completely vegan at restaurants, friends' houses, etc. on ethical grounds. That person just doesn't exist.  So this isn't then a great argument to use because it defends 1) the vast minority of meat consumed in developed countries and 2) an even smaller minority of people's actual positions.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Hunters aren't culling</h4>

<p>Hunters aren't picking out weak animals that are terminally ill ones.  Generally the most desirable animals are the most virile, strongest, and largest. So this isn't an overpopulation control or act of mercy on the animals, so long as people brag about how many points that buck had.  So any argument about controlling the weak animals is even less likely than the argument as a whole.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. This isn't sustainable for the general public</h4>

<p>The number of deer hunted in the <a href="https://business.realtree.com/business-blog/america%E2%80%99s-deer-harvest-numbers">US is about 6 million</a>, which makes 336M lbs of meat, or just about 1 lb per person (This is much larger than other animals like elk for instance, which is about <a href="https://www.backcountrychronicles.com/elk-harvest-comparison-western-states/">6M lbs of meat</a> by my calculation - assuming 400lbs meat/elk - in states when it's common). In the same time, <a href="https://farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/2021/05/an-overview-of-meat-consumption-in-the-united-states.html">The US consumed about 265 lbs/person of meat</a>. So if everyone just relied on deer hunting, we're looking at a 99.5% reduction in meat consumption in the US by these numbers. </p>

<p>So <a href="milkvegan.html">again</a>, the plan that carnists propose to avoid going 100% vegan is to go 99.5% vegan on meat (and 100% on other animal products).</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Killing things instantly doesn't make killing ethical</h4>

<p>We don't consider that painless or quick death is much better ethically than allowing one freedom, even if that freedom comes with risks that one might die.  This argument just doesn't work in any other context.  No one considers shooting loose dogs to be ethical because they might run into some other trouble in the wild.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. Inevitability of the similar doesn't make right</h4>

<p>This defense can be used to justify, for instance, stealing a car. That person was going to lose possession of that car at some point anyway, whether by the car breaking down, the person dying, or whatever (if you argue they were going to sell the car, well whatever they spent that money on would reach the same fate). Ultimately, this argument can be used to justify even murder so long as you imagine your victim might have come across any quantity of bad fortune in their future.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">6. Side effects</h4>

<p>Hunting and hunting-related practices such as the sale and import of deer carcasses have led to exacerbation of chronic wasting disease.  Attempts have been made to control this by banning certain practices around hunting like baiting. But heaven forbid that includes the hunting itself. So this still hurts the ecology. </p>
