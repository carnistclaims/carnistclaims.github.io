<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: I hunt animals as an act of mercy when they would die in the wild anyway</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that hunted meat is ethical because:
- it would be ethical for everyone to only eat meat from hunted animals and abolish animal agriculture.
- hunting is an act of mercy and that killing an animal is therefore a good thing
- carnists are controlling the overpopulation 
- the animal dies instantly rather than letting it starve out from overpopulation</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. No one making this arguments believes it</h4>

<p>I have met zero people that hunt and otherwise eat completely vegan at restaurants, friends' houses, etc. on ethical grounds. That person just doesn't exist.  If that's you, congrats, you get to read on... but if it's not, then close this page and make a different bad argument against veganism.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. It's not sustainable for everyone to eat like this</h4>

<p>The number of deer hunted in the <a href="https://business.realtree.com/business-blog/america%E2%80%99s-deer-harvest-numbers">US is about 6 million</a>, which makes 336M lbs of meat, or just about 1 lb per person (This is much larger than other animals like elk for instance, which is about <a href="https://www.backcountrychronicles.com/elk-harvest-comparison-western-states/">6M lbs of meat</a> by my calculation - assuming 400lbs meat/elk - in states when it's common). In the same time, <a href="https://farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/2021/05/an-overview-of-meat-consumption-in-the-united-states.html">The US consumed about 265 lbs/person of meat</a>. So if everyone just relied on deer hunting, we're looking at a 99.5% reduction in meat consumption in the US by these numbers. So <a href="milkvegan.html">again</a>, the big-brain plan that carnists propose so they don't need to go 100% vegan is to go 99.5% vegan on meat (and 100% on other animal products).  Great plan. 5D chess over here.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Killing things instantly doesn't make killing ethical</h4>

<p>Can I kill a person instantly and it be ethical? No? Ok, so why does that work for animals? "They're a different species" <a href="species.html">doesn't work</a>, <a href="intelligent.html">Intelligence</a> doesn't work. Whatever other answer you have, see the appropriate page.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Inevitability of the similar doesn't make right</h4>

<p>Ok cool, let's go out to a random parking lot and steal a car. Why not? That person was going to lose possession of that car at some point anyways, whether by the car breaking down, the person dying, or whatnot (if you argue they were going to sell the car, well whatever they spent that money on would reach the same fate). We don't just throw our hands up and say, "well, that person was going to die at some point in the future anyways, so lets kill them now".  If you don't like that answer on humans, try it on stray dogs. Are we allowed to hunt stray golden retrievers?  So carnists only believe this argument anyways when its convenient.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. Hunters aren't culling</h4>

<p>Hunters aren't picking out weak animals that are terminally ill ones.  Generally the most desirable animals are the most virile, strongest, and largest. So this isn't an overpopulation control or act of mercy on the animals.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">6. Side effects</h4>

<p>Hunting and hunting-related practices such as the sale and import of deer carcasses have led to exacerbations in chronic wasting disease.  Attempts have been made to control this by banning certain practices around hunting like baiting. But heaven forbid that includes the hunting itself.</p>
