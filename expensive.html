<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Being vegan is expensive</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that it's unreasonable to expect everyone to go vegan because it just costs too much</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Vegan food isn't actually more expensive</h4>

<p>"Beans and rice" is synonymous with cheap living.  If you don't believe that vegan food is cheap, I want you to consider the largest food retailer near my house in the midwest, and the following prices I just grabbed (more or less by randomly searching) as of 12/11/2021 listed on their site (None of these items were on sale at the time), sorted by grams protein per dollar since carnists are so obsessed with protein:</p>

<p>|food                                         |size   |cost   |calories|g protein|cal/$|gprot/$|g protein/cal|cholesterol|

<p>This isn't to say that somehow vegan foods demolish carnist foods every time.  But looking at that list, you'd be hard-pressed to say that vegan food is <strong>so</strong> much more expensive than carnist food. Especially given that 1. all those carnist food are heavily subsidized and 2. laden with antibiotics, cholesterol, and E Coli. If you go to grab more comparable products like antibiotic-free eggs, the price hikes by 55%, dropping it to 26 g protein/dollar, which is dead even with tofu.</p>

<p>This also does not constitute an endorsement of any product listed herein or the Kroger company.  Look around at your own local food retailer. If their prices aren't online take some pictures of items in the store with your phone and then make your own spreadsheet. I'd be surprised if anyone walked away from that exercise thinking that vegan food is only for the rich.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Ethical Implications</h4>

<p>Even though vegan foods are just not any more expensive than carnist food, you simply cannot justify torturing animals by saying "it's so economical".  So what if your premade corn dogs now are double the price per ounce? Consider it a tax for never having to eat extruded pig rectum again. </p>
