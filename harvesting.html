<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: animals die in crop harvesting</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea here is that the act of harvesting plants kills animals by:
- harvesting masceration
- pest removal
- contributing to animal agriculture by the use of animal products such as fertilizer</p>

<p>And therefore eating vegan is not actually vegan.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems with this Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Carnists blow combine masceration out of proportion</h4>

<p>When you mow your lawn are there corpses of animals spewed out of the side of your lawnmower? No? Even though you sometimes see critters running along your back yard? Animals also hate being near harvested fields because there is little cover in those situations.  This isn't some densely populated forest teaming with life. Yet in every discussion carnists make it sound like behind the combine it looks like the opening scene to Saving Private Ryan.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Animals are killed because of carnism</h4>

<p>Yes, animals are not held in high regard and therefore there is no effort to keep animals out of fields, no will to improve mass harvesting technology. Because we need to grow so much food in order to feed to animals, animals are pushed out of their natural ecosystems and they are killed to keep them out of this massive agricultural territory. We also have an abundance of animal-based fertilizer because of meat production, which would not exist if not for carnism. This is all an argument for <em>more</em> veganism. The more we normalize being against animal cruelty the more these problems get fixed.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. If you didn't eat animals you'd still cause less harm</h4>

<p>Eating 1000 calories of chicken still causes <a href="http://www.animalvisuals.org/projects/data/1mc">more than two orders of magnitude more deaths</a> than grains, again, given our current technology and general lack of regard for animals and general will to reduce that number.  <a href="imperfect.html">All of these arguments</a> therefore apply.</p>
