<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Animals die in crop harvesting</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea here is that the act of harvesting plants kills animals by harvesting maceration, pest removal, etc., and therefore:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fewer animals are killed by eating grass-fed beef than eating vegetables</li>
<li>There's no point to go vegan</li>
<li>Vegans are hypocritical in calling carnism unethical</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. This cannot be used as a defense of factory farming</h4>

<p>One can eliminate animal factory farming as covered by this argument right off the bat, since any problem that is caused by farming crops is only going to be magnified by then feeding those crops to animals and reaping even fewer calories and nutrients.  If one retreats to the set of arguments that somehow some smaller number of animals killed by harvesting plants still justifies the greater number killed by animal agriculture, that still doesn't make sense, since that is arguing that one shouldn't reduce the number of animals killed by just ordering something off the menu.  That is to say "I won't move an inch to reduce the deaths by 99% if you don't move a mile to get that last 1%".  Factory farming still remains unethical.</p>

<p>So unless one removes all non-pasture-raised animal products from their diet, this isn't the justification for one's carnism.  It is a plan that avoids going 100% vegan by going <a href="nonarable.html">92%+ vegan</a>. It is challenging to figure out how many exactly the number of animals unintentionally killed in farming is, but safe to say it doesn't touch the number of land animals we kill each year, which estimates go as high as <a href="https://bitesizevegan.org/quantifying-suffering-cruelty-by-the-numbers/">150 billion land animals, and 2.8 trillion fish</a>. Eating 1000 calories of chicken still causes <a href="http://www.animalvisuals.org/projects/data/1mc">2-3 orders of magnitude more deaths</a> than grains, again, given our current technology and general lack of regard for animals and general will to reduce that number.  <a href="imperfect.html">All of these arguments</a> therefore apply.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Combine maceration is over-reported</h4>

<p>Even though you sometimes see critters running along your backyard, there aren't corpses of animals spewed out of the side of your lawnmower when you mow your lawn.  Carnists might pretend that a plowed field is a dense thicket of forest teaming with life, when really most animals also hate being near harvested fields because there is little cover in those situations, especially when the plants are removed from the soil.</p>

<p>The toll from harvesting directly is difficult to calculate because animals <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167880904002944">tend to run away from harvesters</a> and are <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10806-018-9733-8">killed by rodent pesticides much more often</a> rather than by harvesters. These are intentional deaths, which frequently gets rolled the over-reported "unintentional deaths" toll.  But if they are intentional animal deaths that are just too expensive to care to avoid, then they are a result of carnism.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. This is a circular argument</h4>

<p>Yes, animals are not held in high regard and therefore there is no effort to keep animals out of fields, no will to improve mass harvesting technology, and no desire to rely on other animal-exclusion strategies including vertical farming. In addition, because we need to grow so much food in order to feed to farm animals, wild animals are pushed out of their natural ecosystems, thereby increasing the toll.</p>

<p>This is all an argument for <em>more</em> veganism. The more we normalize being against animal cruelty the more these problems get fixed. To claim that we shouldn't go vegan because animals are killed in harvesting is a circular argument, because if we don't care to fix the gaping hole, why plug up the small gaps? But this claim uses the small gaps to justify not plugging up the gaping hole.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Don't like something? Don't participate in it.</h4>

<p>If you think that we need to move away from other forms of animal cruelty that include our current farming techniques, then move to fix that as well. If you have the expertise throw yourself into fixing those problems as well.  You could join a startup, or start a community or personal garden, or do ecological research. If you think you really need to move that extra mile to justify that initial inch, then </p>
