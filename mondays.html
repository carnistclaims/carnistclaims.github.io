<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Why are vegans against Meatless Mondays? I thought they'd be for saving even a single animal</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vegans should be for incrementalism, such as meatless mondays, flexitarianism, vegetarianism, etc.</li>
<li>Veganism is hypocritical for being black and white about things on the basis of some other argument, e.g. <a href="imperfect.html">that you can't be 100% vegan</a>, or <a href="everybody.html">that one animal saved is still good even if the whole world isn't vegan</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Vegans don't disagree that any single animal saved is a good thing</h4>

<p>The real reason that vegans tend to oppose meatless mondays is because it gives the person a feeling of warm absolution by contributing literally nothing. I mean, if you think about Meatless Mondays, the idea is to go from 100% meat eating to 87%, not even taking into account that trading in a beef burrito for one loaded with cheese and sour cream still contributes to animal deaths and fuels the calf-slaughtering business. Flexitarian in this way is a worthless term.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. People tend to be absolutist in other situations where unethical things are mentioned</h4>

<p>It's not that weird to see little difference between raping and 'only raping a little'. Or 'abstaining from murder on Mondays'.  Typically, people discuss other criminal behavior in absolutist terms.  Why is it weird to consider 'I put baby chicks in a shredder' not a real step up from 'I cut an animal's throat'?</p>
