<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: I will define carnism as axiomatically ok; morality is subjective anyway</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>I give this type of argument the name "axiomaticism".</p>

<p>The claim here is that we can axiomatically define morality to include carnism, and therefore carnism is justified.  Another form of the argument is "I will axiomatically define category X as justified, carnism is of category X. Therefore carnism is justified."  This fundamentally underpins every single argument of the designation EH, AA, and AH on this website, amongst others e.g. </p>

<ul>
<li>"I will axiomatically define what is <a href="legal.html">legal</a>, <a href="lions.html">natural</a>, <a href="developed.html">selected for by evolution</a> as ethical." </li>
<li>"I will axiomatically define what happens to <a href="humanrights.html">non-humans</a>, <a href="pooling.html">what I pay for (rather than do myself)</a> to not be unethical."</li>
<li>"I will axiomatically define <a href="nihilism.html">everything within the same moral designation</a> of ethical"</li>
<li>"I will axiomatically define <a href="dillahunty.html">animal cruelty as not a moral imperative</a> but good on you, I guess, if you want to be vegan"</li>
</ul>

<p>And infinitely more...</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's not morality then</h4>

<p>Nothing prevents me from axiomatically define myself as the only being towards which moral obligations exist. Murder is now ethical. </p>

<p>Unless it focuses on the reduction of needless harm towards the well-being of conscious beings, it can't be morality.  Even if one axiomatically define indiscriminate murder as moral and anything else immoral, but is that really actually morality?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. There are humans impacted</h4>

<p>If we wants internally consistent morality, we have to take into account the human impact of eating animals. If one wants to then axiomatically make it ok to hurt other people by all the ways that carnism does, it starts to become ok and not ok to do highly arbitrary combinations of things. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. If you make this argument, just admit it already</h4>

<p>Eating animal products inflicts needless suffering and reduction on the well-being of conscious creatures for one's own entertainment, both animal and human. There's not a good justification for this <a href="justified.html">in any reasonable moral system</a>.  If one then claims that somehow entertainment is worth more than a sound moral system, then the discussion has moved from ethics to potential medication for psychopathy.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. If you refuse to care, that doesn't make you right</h4>

<p>One can just repeat <a href="dontcare.html">"I don't care" repeatedly </a> as a substitute for reasoned argument.  That doesn't make for sound reasoning.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Related Claims</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="godsaid.html">"God told me personally that [thing everyone agrees on] is wrong, but eating animals is ok."</a></li>
</ul>
