<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: I will define carnism as axiomatically ok; morality is subjective anyways</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>I give this type of argument the name "axiomaticism".</p>

<p>The claim here is that we can axiomatically define morality to include carnism, and therefore carnism is justified.  Another form of the argument is "I will axiomatically define category X as justified, carnism is of category X. Therefore carnism is justified."  This fundamentally underpins every single argument of the designation EH, AA, and AH on this website, amongst others e.g. </p>

<ul>
<li>"I will axiomatically define what is <a href="legal.html">legal</a>, <a href="lions.html">natural</a>, <a href="developed.html">selected for by evolution</a> as ethical." </li>
<li>"I will axiomatically define what happens to <a href="humanrights.html">non-humans</a>, <a href="pooling.html">what I pay for (rather than do myself)</a> to not be unethical."</li>
<li>"I will axiomatically define <a href="nihilism.html">everything within the same moral designation</a> of ethical"</li>
<li>"I will axiomatically define <a href="dillahunty.html">animal cruelty as not a moral imperative</a> but good on you, I guess, if you want to be vegan"</li>
</ul>

<p>And infinitely more...</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's not morality then</h4>

<p>Ok, Great! I axiomatically define myself as the only being towards which moral obligations exist. Murder is now ethical. </p>

<p>Call it schmorality, or whatever you want.  But unless it focuses on the reduction of needless harm towards the well-being of conscious beings, it can't be morality.  I can axiomatically define indiscriminate murder as moral and anything else immoral, but is that really actually morality?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. You really pretzel up on human impact</h4>

<p>If you want your morality to be internally consistent, you have to take into account the human impact of eating animals. If you want to axiomatically make it ok to hurt other people, it starts to become ok and not ok to do highly arbitrary combinations of things. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. If you make this argument, just admit it already</h4>

<p>You're inflicting needless suffering and reducing the well-being of conscious creatures for your own entertainment when you eat meat, both animal and human. There's not a good justification for this in any reasonable moral system if you still want it to be called a moral system.  If you claim that somehow your entertainment is worth more than a sound moral system, then you've moved the discussion from ethics to potential medication for psychopathy.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. If you refuse to care, that doesn't make you right</h4>

<p>You can just repeat <a href="dontcare.html">"I don't care" repeatedly </a> as a substitute for reasoned argument.  That doesn't make your reasoning sound.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Verdict</h2>

<p>Axiomatically defining something as ethical doesn't make it so.</p>
