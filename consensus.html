<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Consensus on vegan diets being nutritionally adequate is fake</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) has the following problems with their position:</p>

<ul>
<li>was founded by Seventh-day Adventists</li>
<li>has conflicts of interest</li>
</ul>

<p>Other organizations, such as:
- Dietitians of Canada, 
- The USDA, <br />
- The British Dietetic Association, 
- the Australian Dietary Guidelines, 
- and Kaiser Permanente</p>

<p>All have the same problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Just echo the position without citing sources</li>
<li>Have some adventist or vegan organization ties</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Which is it?</h4>

<p>Aren't seventh-day adventists known for living extremely long and healthy lives? So probably you shouldn't claim (as the antivegan copypasta does) that there's no nutritional benefits when they clearly are completely crushing it with regards to their health.  This is <a href="shill">another poor attempt</a> to discredit positions that are given by organizations as they cite hundred of studies, reviews, and meta-analyses in formulating their position.  For instance, the AND has over 100k members, are they all seventh-day adventists?  </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. This is a fundamentally a shifting of the burden of proof</h4>

<p>If there were some clear sign of bias, they would just cite that.  Instead the authors of this claim opt for a conspiratorial analysis that includes international non-profit and government organizations, in addition to insurance companies.  Not to mention other organizations that have the same position, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Portuguese National Programme for the Promotion of a Healthy Diet, </li>
<li>The British Nutrition Foundation, </li>
<li>The Canadian Paediatric Society, </li>
<li>UK National Health Service, </li>
<li>The Mayo Clinic</li>
<li>Harvard Medical School.  </li>
</ul>

<p>...all of these groups are all in on it, see? Unfortunately, conspiracy theories are by definition undisprovable because you expect a lack of evidence for your position, so any lack of evidence you find is just "more evidence you're right".  Unfortunately, carnism bears the <a href="burden">burden of proof</a> so you can't use an unfalsifiable assertion to defend another unfalsifiable assertion.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Related Claims</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="orgs.html">There are organizations that do not recommend vegan diets</a></li>
<li><a href="shill.html">Any doctor promoting veganism is a shill</a></li>
</ul>
