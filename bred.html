<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Animals are bred for agricultural use</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim is in various forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>it's ok to do X to animals because they are bred for purpose X.</li>
<li>it's ok to do X to animals because they are bred for purpose X, some other purpose Y, or some combination of the two.</li>
<li>they would not have been born if not for the motivation of the human towards purpose X.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Which is it?</h4>

<p>Carnists will routinely refer to <a href="hunting.html">hunting</a> as being the only humane way to obtain meat, or <a href="lions.html">claims about what lions would do</a>, which is in direct contradiction with this claim since hunted animals by definition aren't bred.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. What about dogs?</h4>

<p>Humans have bred dogs for 1000s of years.  Does that make golden retriever steaks ok?  If breeding for purpose X is carte blanche for action X, one should also consider that most dog fighting dogs are bred for that exact purpose.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Bred for suffering?</h4>

<p>Selective breeding for traits like "is made of more/tastier meat" doesn't actually change the amount of suffering an animal undergoes.  Frequently the opposite - most animals suffer greatly because their body proportions have been exaggerated.  So this argument is actually an argument <em>for</em> veganism, not against it, because the breeding of animals in this fashion should be considered unethical.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Natalist fatalist?</h4>

<p>Accordin to this argument, it should also be ok for two people to have a child explicitly for the purpose of torturing that child for their own entertainment.  In fact, that makes any claim of child abuse impossible for any intentional pregnancy, since this child was technically bred for purpose and therefore one has carte blanche for any proposed action.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. Collateral Damage</h4>

<p>This still doesn't address the damage done to the ecosystem, clearing land for breeding these animals, starvation of food from third-world countries to feed livestock. The eating of cultivated meat for one's own entertainment hurts plenty of non-bred animals</p>
