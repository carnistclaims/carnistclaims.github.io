<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Animals are bred for agricultural use</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim is in various forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>it's ok to do X to animals because they are bred for purpose X.</li>
<li>it's ok to do X to animals because they are bred for purpose X, some other purpose Y, or some combination of the two.</li>
<li>they would not have been born if not for the motivation of the human towards purpose X.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. This probably isn't your actual justification</h4>

<p>Do you disagree morally with hunting? Do you ethically obstain from all meat that might be obtained from 'food' animals not bred for the purposes of food, like  hogs, or wild turkeys, or buffalo? If not, then you're just filibustering with random arguments, not presenting your actual justification.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. What about dogs?</h4>

<p>Humans have bred dogs for 1000s of years.  Does that make golden retriever steaks ok?  What about dogfighting? If breeding for purpose X is carte blanche for action X, you should know that most dogfighting dogs are bred for that exact purpose.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Bred for suffering?</h4>

<p>Selective breeding for traits like 'is made of more/tastier meat' doesn't actually change the amount of suffering an animal undergoes.  Frequently the opposite - most animals suffer greatly because their body proportions have been exaggerated.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Natalist fatalist?</h4>

<p>If you believe in the final form of the argument, then it should also be ok for two people to have a child explicitly for the purpose of torturing that child for their own entertainment.  In fact, that makes any claim of child abuse impossible for any intentional pregnancy. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. Collateral Damage</h4>

<p>This still doesn't address the damage done to the ecosystem, clearing land for breeding these animals, starvation of food from third-world countries to feed livestock. You are hurting plenty of non-bred animals when you eat cultivated meat for your own entertainment.</p>
