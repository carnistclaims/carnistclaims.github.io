<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Dietary cholesterol is good for you</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>Research over the past decade seems to show that dietary cholesterol doesn't appear to raise LDL levels.  Carnists (and in particular self-identifying "antivegans") overextend this research and make a variety of claims regarding cholesterol, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>the claim that veganism is unhealthy because it lacks cholesterol</li>
<li>the denialism high blood cholesterol causes heart disease</li>
<li>foods that are largely considered to increase heart disease (e.g. egg, red meat) actually lower it</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Cholesterol is not an essential nutrient</h4>

<p>I'm not sure how to attack a claim that "cholesterol is a valuable micronutrient that vegans lack" when looking around at scientific papers I can't really seem to find any that substantiate that claim.  All I can say is that your body already makes cholesterol in sufficient quantities so it's, on the face, not particularly reasonable, and this claim can't be taken seriously as a reason to abuse animals given the lack of presented evidence.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Blood cholesterol definitely causes heard disease</h4>

<p>The AHA (the multi-billion-dollar medical research organization charged with the CPR certification of essentially every healthcare worker in America) 
puts it in no uncertain terms on their site that <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/about-cholesterol">cholesterol</a>, in particular <a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/hdl-good-ldl-bad-cholesterol-and-triglycerides">LDL</a>, causes heart disease.  There really is no debate there</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Eggs and red meat definitely don't lower your chances of heart disease</h4>

<p>The main source of this set of scientific denialism is some version of the "antivegan copypasta" which has <a href="https://sentientdarkness.medium.com/comprehensive-debunk-of-an-anti-vegan-nutrition-copypasta-e677a538cc16">serious problems in the papers it cites on the topic</a>.  Upon further investigation, the copypasta appears to have been revised at some point to drop some of these claims...? Not sure what the versioning is there.</p>

<p>Regardless, The aforementioned AHA's recommendations for physicians in a recent, comprehensive, and well-cited <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31838890/">meta-analysis</a> are as follows: "Dietary guidance should focus on healthy dietary patterns (e.g., Mediterranean-style and DASH [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension]â€“style diets) that are inherently relatively low in cholesterol with typical levels similar to the current US intake. These patterns emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat or fat-free dairy products, lean protein sources, nuts, seeds, and liquid vegetable oils."  The full paper has some more specific recommendation that include <em>limits</em> on egg and meat consumption. This idea that red meat and eggs lower heart disease is just not substantiated.</p>
