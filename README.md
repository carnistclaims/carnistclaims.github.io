# About

### What is this website?

This site is dedicated to finding a response to every single defense a carnist (or a vegan I suppose) has ever put out in justification of non-veganism.  Due to the varied, multiple, unique, and creative ways that carnists justify killing animals it's hard to track them all and you start playing argument whack-a-mole. Rather than type the same counters to the same few arguments you can say "see this page, point 3".

### Who are you? What is your political stance? What entitles you to make these arguments?

Some dude on the internet. It doesn't matter.  Veganism is about the victims not the abusers or debaters.

### Why did you make this website?

I'm annoyed with bad arguments which has lit the fire under me to make this.  It's mostly inspired in form by the [talkorigins archive](http://talkorigins.org/indexcc/list.html).

### Are there any limitations on the arguments you consider?

I try to keep this somewhat high-level but I'm sure that it'll get more in the weeds as time goes on. I'm confident that one day the mop of carnist.cc will hopefully touch every corner of the internet.

### Isn't this just ["Your Vegan Fallacy Is"](http://www.yourveganfallacyis.com)?

Yes, we are both sites countering carnist claims, but YVFI 1. Isn't attempting to catalogue them all (or at least that's not an apparent goal.) so that kind of hampers the use of the site. I want to be the end-all-be-all resource for all the arguments, rather than a partial list of major resources. 2. I'm also creating a taxonomy of these arguments, not just disperately listing them out, which helps with searching and keeping track of them 3. The more the merrier. If you like that site, use that site; if you like mine, use mine.

### How can I support this page?

At the moment there are two methods of support: 1. Just use the page whenever you're in an argument and 2. Help by suggesting edits on [github](https://github.com/carnistclaims/carnistclaims.github.io/issues) by opening an 'issue'.

### I want to build a site like this. How did you make this website?

It's just a bunch of markdown files I run through Jinja templates that use getbootstrap, and about 50 lines of python that turns them into code and inserts them into the claims index.

### What if your website disappears?
