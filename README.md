# About

### What is this website?

This site is dedicated to finding a response to every single defense a carnist has ever put out in justification of non-veganism.  Due to the varied, multiple, unique, and creative ways that carnists justify killing animals it's hard to track them all and you start playing argument whack-a-mole. Rather than type the same counters to the same few arguments you can say "see this page, point 3".

### What is a carnist?

A "Carnist" is a non-vegan. "Vegan" is a silly term, let alone negating it with "non-vegan".  We don't have terms like "non-car-thief" or "non-murderer".  If you don't engage in unethical behavior you're the default, and when you do, that deserves the label in any other context. So I'm a non-carnist, which people generally call a "vegan", and if you engage in animal agriculture, you're a carnist.

### Who are you? I think you are actually...

No, I'm not Vegan Gains, Vegan Teacher, or whoever is your least-favorite vegan on the internet. I'm some dude that you don't know. I went vegan around the time I finished my Chemistry PhD.  I'm mostly annoyed with bad arguments which has lit the fire under me to make this.  It's mostly inspired in form by the [talkorigins archive](http://talkorigins.org/indexcc/list.html).  

### Isn't this another list site for veganism?

Yes, there are many sites countering carnist claims, but those other sites 1. aren't attempting to catalogue them all (or at least that's not an apparent goal.) so that kind of hampers the use of the site. I want to be the end-all-be-all resource for all the arguments, rather than a partial list of major resources. 2. I'm also creating a taxonomy of these arguments, not just disparately listing them out, which helps with searching and keeping track of them 3. The more the merrier. If you like some other site, use that site; if you like mine, use mine. Check out the [resources](resources.html) page for other sources of arguments.

### How can I support this page?

At the moment there are two methods of support: 1. Just use the page whenever you're in an argument and 2. Help by suggesting edits on [github](https://github.com/carnistclaims/carnistclaims.github.io/issues) by opening an 'issue'.
