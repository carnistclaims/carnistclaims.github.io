<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Milk production is not harmful to farmed animals</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The cow on the carton is smiling.  I mean, so how could it be unethical with drinking milk today from a grocery store?</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. It's fiction</h4>

<p>Carnists imagine a smiling cow on a hill with a giant bell around its neck where a blonde girl with two braids and a blue apron comes up the hill with a bucket to milk the cow under a rainbow. Eliminate this image from your mind.  It has nothing to do with reality.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. The nasty reality</h4>

<p>Actual milk production starts with forceful artifical insemination, involves a guy with a hand gloved up to his shoulder and the rest leaves little to the imagination.  The cow gives birth and the calf is seperated from the mother to avoid cutting into the yield too much, and is either sold off to be slaughtered within a few months of being alive, or... if it's a female in good condition it can be raised to perpetuate the cycle.  The cow will continue this cycle, and will probably be killed before its sixth birthday, well before its life expectancy of 20 years.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. The results</h4>

<p>Given that the production of milk is inherently tied to the slaughter of animals, vegans argue (correctly) that lactovegetarianism represents 0% middle ground between slaughtering animals and not.  By drinking milk you are still subsidizing the slaughter of animals, and <a href="milkfarm.html">it doesn't matter if it's a 'local farm'</a>, either, so all of those arguments apply.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Collateral Damage</h4>

<p>You still are paying for cows to take food from developing countries, you're still contributing to the unsustainability of the animal agriculture industry, and doing a lot of ecological damage.  Taking the milk and not the meat doesn't actually solve any of those issues, either.</p>
