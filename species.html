<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: I base my morality on a species-by-species basis</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea is that eating animals is ok because morality is evaluated on a species-by-species basis with all members of the same species receiving the same moral benefits.</p>

<p>The thing that's important here is that we're ignoring emergent properties - we're not talking about how members of species X have characteristic Y, and the real criterion is characteristic Y - we're talking about the claim of species X itself being a criterion for morality.  E.g. Not that we know dogs can't operate motor vehicles and therefore we restrict their ability to own a driver's license, but rather that dog-ness itself gives you some moral benefit that, say, cow-ness does not,namely the right to not be slaughtered for meat, on the basis of what characteristics a majority of dogs or cows possess, respectively.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. This is really just special pleading</h4>

<p>This is a pretty clear-cut case of "Humans are in a different category and I treat them differently because... reasons".  And almost every argument turns into a "Brawndo's got electrolytes"-type discussion. There's no legitimate reason to treat different species differently on the basis of what species they belong to alone.  This becomes apparent when you start to discuss, say, infants, people with developmental disabilities, or if you want to have a lot of fun with carnists, extraterrestrials. Now, all of the sudden, the emergent properties start to matter and the apparent nature of the dividing line of 'species' is even more obviously a deflection.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Species isn't even a single thing</h4>

<p>The problem with using 'species' is that boundaries on species are fuzzy, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species">ring species</a> a single 'species' by this definition?  What about Neanderthals or other early hominids? If we put them in a time machine to the present, would an appropriate dividing line really be ability to interbreed with modern humans?  So this is already a problematic and fuzzy area, and if you think that fuzzy boundaries are no problem, remember we're talking about a dividing line as harsh as 'you go to jail for killing species X' and 'you go to jail for stopping someone from killing species Y'. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Species is an arbitrary choice</h4>

<p>You choose species. Cool, I choose skin color... or race... or gender.  Wait, what makes species a better dividing line? Every single answer ever given has been name-the-trait can-kicking at best. E.g. "Oh, it's because it's what the animal can give birth to", or any other characteristic that's just arbitrary redefinition of species. And since all modern animals have a common ancestor, it begins to get even more arbitrary. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Carnists don't even believe their own argument</h4>

<p>Some quick examples where this feeble defense doesn't even represent their true position:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Carnists don't treat all members of the same species the same:</strong> Ask a carnist if they'd eat a golden retriever and most would say no.  But coyote hunting is a thing, and most carnists won't object to it, even though coyotes, wolves, and dogs are - get this - all the same species. And there are plenty of cases where carnists don't grant different members of the human species the same rights, such as infants or people with developmental disabilities.   </li>
<li><strong>Carnists don't actually evaluate individual species:</strong>  Whenever a carnist runs into a new species, why do they tend to lump them in together with completely different species?  Like if a carnist ran across a yellowtail, there wouldn't be significant evaluation as to whether to treat it similarly to, say, a tuna.  Why is that?  Why would they kind of start to lump in all the fish together? If it really is a species by species basis, wouldn't they need to know more about the animal itself, and do more significant tests? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtmLVP0HvDg">Crows can create tools, for instance</a>, does that mean that crows should enjoy some additional rights? What if it was just one crow, or a minority of crows, that could create tools? There's no way to answer these questions without further special pleading.</li>
<li><strong>Carnists don't actually evaluate morality by class:</strong> because that's a silly thing to do in any other context. Why should the morality of individual A towards individual X be dictated by the existence or characteristics of individual Y or W that are not part of this transaction? It doesn't make sense that it might be morally impermissible to do something to an individual, but the existence of a few copies of that being with similar characteristics on the other side of the planet now changes that calculus of what is moral.</li>
<li><strong>Carnists don't actually evaluate morality by birth capacity:</strong> If we create a single member of a new species of animal in a lab, would it matter if we created a single one? Do sterile animals like mules have different moral characteristics because they can't give birth to a horse or any other species? There's no way to answer these questions without further special pleading.</li>
</ul>

<p>So carnists don't believe or follow their own argument anyway.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. Collateral damage</h4>

<p>This argument still doesn't take into account the ecological and human impact of eating meat, and it remains unethical for those reasons as well.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">6. This is just another example of carnist axiomaticism with scientific designation as the criterion</h4>
