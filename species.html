<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: I base my morality on a species-by-species basis</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The thing that's important here is that we're ignoring emergent properties - we're not talking about how members of species X have characteristic Y, and the real criterion is characteristic Y - we're talking about the claim of species X itself being a criterion for morality.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Species isn't even a single thing</h4>

<p>The problem with using 'species' is that boundaries on species are fuzzy, is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_species">ring species</a> a single 'species' by this definition?  What about Neanderthals or other early hominids, would they enjoy the same rights as humans if we time-machined them into the present, and would an appropriate dividing line really be ability to interbreed with modern humans?  So this is already a problematic and fuzzy area, and if you think that fuzzy boundaries are no problem, remember we're talking about a dividing line as harsh as 'you go to jail for killing species X' and 'you go to jail for stopping someone from killing species Y'. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Species is an arbitrary choice</h4>

<p>You choose species. Cool, I choose skin color... or race... or gender.  Wait, what makes species a better dividing line? Every single answer ever given has been name-the-trait can-kicking at best. E.g. "Oh, it's because it's what the animal can give birth to", or any other characteristic that's just arbitrary redefinition of species. And since all modern animals have a common ancestor, it begins to get even more arbitrary.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Carnists don't even believe their own argument</h4>

<p>Ask a carnist if they'd eat a golden retriever and most would say no.  But coyote hunting is a thing, and most carnists won't object to it, even though coyotes, wolves, and dogs are - get this - all the same species. And there are plenty of cases where carnists don't grant different members of the human species the same rights.  So their own argument isn't even followed or truly believed by carnists anyway.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. Morality by class doesn't make sense</h4>

<p>Why should the morality of individual A towards individual X be dictated by the existence or characteristics of individual Y or W that are not part of this transaction? Is there any other (less morally convenient) example wherein that's the case? E.g. why is the morality of whether or not I get to kill you based on whether or not there are a bunch of other things that look like you around such that I get to bunch you all in together in a group in terms of rights? </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">Morality by what it can give birth to doesn't make sense</h4>

<p>If we create a single member of a new species of animal in a lab, would it matter if we created a single one? Do sterile animals like mules have different moral characteristics? And also whenever a carnist runs into a new species, why do they tend to lump them in together with different species.  Like if a carnist ran across a yellowtail, there wouldn't be significant evaluation as to </p>

<p>Between that and the problems above, It starts to become clear that we really are assigning </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">5. Collateral damage</h4>

<p>This argument still doesn't take into account the ecological and human impact of eating meat, and it remains unethical for those reasons as well.</p>
