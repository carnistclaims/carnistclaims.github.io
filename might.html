<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Might makes right is inevitable but isn't so bad.</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, you always do what you want (because if you didn't want to do something you wouldn't)</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. This is still special pleading</h4>

<p>This is sort of the next level of palisade that one can build.  You can skirt the issue that you <a href="species">give certain animals certain rights</a> by claiming that you <a href="humanrights">only give humans rights</a>.  If you then want to avoid that level of special pleading, you can claim that you don't give anyone else rights except yourself and whatever you desire.  In short, that might makes right.</p>

<p>The problem is that this is still <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Special_pleading">special pleading</a>, namely that you are attempting to give yourself rights that you don't give anyone else.  So then that would mean that you alone are the object of moral value.  So to avoid this fallacy, you would need to demonstrate that you have some property that is unique to you that showed that you alone have subjective experience or that your experience is qualitatively different from everyone else on the planet.  For instance, if you were the only person on Earth that demonstrated activity in an fMRI machine, and everyone else had a completely blank scan.  Barring any unusual properties that you alone have, you would not be logically justified in making such an assertion.  Not even "But I am the only person that I can verify has subjective experience" because anyone can say that.</p>

<p>Barring any such demonstration, the argument falls apart.</p>
