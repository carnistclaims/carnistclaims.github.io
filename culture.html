<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: It's our culture to eat meat</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that animal cruelty is a part of a particular culture and is therefore justified as a part of preserving the culture.  It's basically three bad arguments rolled together:</p>

<ul>
<li>eating meat is ok because <a href="normal.html">everyone else is doing it</a></li>
<li>eating meat is ok because we've been doing it <a href="thousands.html">for a long time</a></li>
<li>we need to preserve culture (addressed on this page)</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Preserving culture isn't worth animal cruelty</h4>

<p>Cultures change. It once was a sign of status as to how many slaves one owned.  That was not worth holding onto for its own sake.  It was once part of Aztec culture to decapitate people at the top of temples.  Do you really want "culture" to be <em>carte blanche</em> for <strong>anything</strong>?  Can I claim "suicide bombing is just culture.  It's just another form of communication.  You're saying "I really don't like your style", just with explosives instead of words"? Why can I cherry pick what aspects of "culture" I'm willing to preserve as a part of forcing suffering onto sentient beings. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Culture</h4>

<p>If you don't think it matters that carnism hurts animals, well it hurts other people too. So is there any significant difference to me justifying nuking a country because it is part of some imagined "American Culture" of guns and reckless sovereign nation invasion? If it doesn't work there, then why does it work for starving other countries of their resources so you can have your "culture"?  You're still externalizing the costs on other people.</p>
