<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Veganism is associated with protein deficiency</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that carnism is necessary to avoid protein deficiency</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems with this argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Protein is just as easily available on a vegan as a carnist diet</h4>

<p><a href="expensive.html">As shown in debunking the myth that vegan food is expensive</a>, protein isn't any less available on a vegan versus a carnist diet. So this argument doesn't make any sense.  It stems from people associating the word 'protein' with 'meat' but in reality foods like ground beef is a very poor source of protein and are demolished in cost per gram of protein and protein per calorie of foods like tofu and lentils.  It actually also loses in a head-to-head match against most vegan ground beef crumbles, the antibiotics and hormones nonwithstanding.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. People don't understand macronutrients</h4>

<p>Given that an average 38-year-old male, 5'10", 160 lbs needs <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/calorie-calculator/itt-20402304">2250 calories</a> and <a href="https://www.calculator.net/protein-calculator.html">60-ish grams</a> (depending on whom you ask) of protein, you can get your entire protein requirements from eating only potatoes in a day (Same with, say, an average female of 5'7" and 150 lbs).  Whole day, nothing but dry potatoes, your protein goal is met. "But potatoes are just a starch!" Yes, but this idea that you need an insane amount of protein is blown out of proportion. I can't help but thing that there's got to be some underlying thing where somehow people think that just eating protein without exercise is somehow going to put them in better shape or something.  This lasts right up until the heart attack.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124841/">only 5% of people are meeting their daily fiber requirements</a>.  So, no, you don't need protein.  Eat a vegetable.</p>
