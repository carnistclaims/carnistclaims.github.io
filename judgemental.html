<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Vegans are judgemental</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claim here is that veganism isn't worth joining because vegans are judgemental</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. This is tacit approval of the vegan position</h4>

<p>You accidentally proved yourself wrong if you make this argument. If you had reasons to be against veganism, then you'd say it.  But you can't simultaneously say "I'm mad at you for your attitude towards my unethical choices" and "They aren't unethical".  Either carnism is ethical or it's not.  If it is, then you wouldn't say this, you'd say 'Vegans are wrong', not 'vegans are judgmeental', and if it is unethical, then you're agreeing with the vegans. But you can't have your cake and eat it too.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Fine. Make ethical choices and don't use the label vegan</h4>

<p>If you want to make ethical choices make them, no one is forcing you to use the label vegan if you feel like you're forced into joining some club. You just happen to be a person that boycotts the use of animal products but doesn't use any labels. And anyway, labels are just linguistic shortcuts that make it so you don't need to reexplain everything each time.  If you don't want to use one, that's on you.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. The reason to accept an argument is the strength of its premises</h4>

<p>Not some imagined motivation of the arguers. The reason to ditch carnism is because it hurts animals, humans, the environment, and yourself. Anything else is white noise.</p>
