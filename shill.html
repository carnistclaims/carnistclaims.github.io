<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Any doctor promoting veganism is a shill</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The idea here is that veganism is so unhealthy that obviously one could never promote such a diet without being a shill</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. Evidence Please?</h4>

<p>I haven't actually run across any doctor that provably has a conflict of interest in the direction of veganism. One can always unfalsifiably claim 'Study X would have found that veganism is bad if not for the interest of the people leading it', but without any clear connection, it's indisputable. </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Veganism has no vested interest, meat production does</h4>

<p>Meat production in the US is highly subsidized by tax dollars, and consumes much more resources than otherwise vegan alternatives. So if there were a 'big tofu', they would also be vested in increasing animal agriculture since most soy grown worldwide is fed to farm animals. Same for resources like water or grain.  There definitely is 'big beef'; there is no 'big vegan'.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. Oh, you mean like this?</h4>

<p>Would <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2021.1974336">this paper</a> be an example of shilling? Particularly the part where "This study was funded in part via an unrestricted research grant from the Beef Checkoff, through the National Cattlemenâ€™s Beef Association. The sponsor of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report."  Or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34712894/">this one</a>, which has negative things to say about vegetarianism in kids, funded by, again, the Beef Checkoff. In some cases they are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030917401400196X?via%3Dihub">conducted directly</a> by this organization.  What is this Beef Checkoff? Per <a href="https://www.beefboard.org/checkoff/">their website</a>, "The Beef Checkoff program is a national marketing and research program designed to increase the demand for beef at home and abroad. This can be accomplished through initiatives such as consumer advertising, marketing partnerships, public relations, education, research and new-product development." Or <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/11/1695/htm">this one</a> funded by Astrazeneca, makers of Crestor. </p>

<p>This is from just poking around for a few minutes.  Someone ought to make a more complete list (most articles have funding within the fulltext that is typically behind paywalls). If someone puts a more comprehensive list online somewhere I'll link to it.</p>

<p>Here is a list of authors I have found that appear on papers funded by cattle/dairy-promoting thinktanks and organizations and links to the respective articles:
