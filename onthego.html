<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: It's hard to be vegan while traveling</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>I'm on the move, </p>

<ul>
<li>how can I stay vegan? </li>
<li>I want to enjoy the local culture</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. The local culture is a bad argument against veganism</h4>

<p>Would you enjoy the local <a href="culture.html">culture</a> if it was to throw baby kittens into shredders?  What about if it meant torturing dogs with hot irons?  ... Or more concretely, what about, say, Yulin dog festival?  These are all things which most people agree are unethical, but somehow if you're traveling does that mean it's no longer unethical?</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Think about the victim</h4>

<p>Would it matter to you, if you were killed, that the person was "just passing through" or wanted to enjoy the local culture of shooting guns in random directions or driving drunk or whatever happens to happen frequently in your area?  Probably not.  Similarly, if you abuse an animal which traveling, it's probably not a significant comfort to the tortured animal that you were an outsider joining in.  In fact doesn't that kind of make it worse - that someone didn't even have the excuse of inertia and lifelong brainwashing and they <em>decided</em> to join in as an outsider?</p>

<p>If carnism is unethical then it's unethical regardless of if it's a special occasion or not.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. You have so many options!</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Just eat local vegan food:</strong> Name a place. Unless you have some major health issue (on the scale of being fed through a tube into your stomach or an IV), you can be vegan there. Look Up on <a href="https://www.happycow.net/">HappyCow</a> any place where you might travel, or just look up the place on a general search engine followed by the word "vegan".</li>
<li><strong>Go someplace else:</strong> If you think that you won't be able to behave ethically within some set of circumstances, maybe you should evaluate whether or not you really want to put yourself in that circumstance.  If you think that in some part of the world you won't be able to be vegan, consider going someplace more vegan friendly.  Sometimes, those places can be really close to each other, such as just traveling to a different island within an archipelago or something.</li>
<li><strong>Pack your food:</strong> If nothing else, pack a suitcase full of clif bars or other non-perishable foods that can sustain you in the absence of any vegan food.  You won't die from popping a multivitamin and eating like that for two weeks of vacation if you're of even mildly good health. Heck, even youtuber CGP prey <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex">talks</a> about packing an entire suitcase full of Quest Bars on his trips. </li>
</ul>

<p>I guess it's up to you if you want to live based on ethics you agree with, but if you do then you definitely can.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. This also doesn't apply in every-day life</h4>

<p>If you are still not convinced you could go vegan when you happen to be in an area, then that can't be the justification for why you eat meat day in and day out.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Verdict</h2>

<p>You can be vegan while traveling if you actually want to.</p>
