<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: Dogs are more useful animals</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The claims are variously:
- Dogs deserve higher moral standards because dogs can protect you from mountain lions or other threats. 
- A sheep cannot protect you and therefore morally speaking does not deserve moral standards equal to that of a dog. <br />
- The usefulness of a cow is limited to what it can make for us for food so therefore they have no moral protections against being food.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. This is just "might makes right" with selfishness added in</h4>

<p>Here the argument is simply that "might makes right", i.e. that if you're capable of something then you're justified in doing so, but with the additional gem of a caveat that you're also very self interested. So, you're morally justified in doing what you what to whomever you want, but - and here's the brilliant catch - only if you want to and it suits you. </p>

<p>Want to make a horse carry a load until its hooves bleed?  That's what it's useful for.  She can't walk any more? Bullet to the head. Dog is useful?  Keep it. Cat is not useful? enjoy throwing it off a cliff and smack the ground below. </p>

<p>This is psychopathic - to the point where I couldn't keep a straight face if I attempted to use the term "morality" for this position.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. The calculus of dogs here is off</h4>

<p>You might be overestimating your 35 lb. beagle's protection against a 200 lb. cougar. Go look at a picture of those animals side by side.  On the other hand, a nice fattened up dog could easily make as good of a meal as any other animal.   So for dogs in particular, this kind of falls apart.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">3. These are arbitrary metrics</h4>

<p>How many mountain lions have you encountered in your life?  I'm going to guess zero.  Why do you need protection from mountain lions, why not sharks? </p>

<p>Also, not that this should even matter, but on the basis of this absurd scenario, wouldn't actually it make more sense to have an animal that runs slow that you can outrun that can essentially sacrifice itself to the cougar? Most dogs will probably run from the mountain lion that's literally seven times its size, and a race between you and a beagle is not even going to be close; you're lunch.  And just for my edification: does this also apply to humans? So if there's a dog and a toddler in a burning building - I'm supposed to save the dog because it's more useful at that moment.  Unless, you know, I need something that only a toddler can deliver for some reason.</p>

<p>While we're on the topic - even if we assume a dog protects you from mountain lions and if this is a coherent metric, consider this: if you own some basic firearms, then that offers significantly more protection than a dog. So then would it be morally permissible to eat a dog as long as you own a gun? And if you had to, say, pawn the gun for a vet bill towards saving your dog's life, would you say that it's morally reprehensible to give up the gun, your protection against mountain lions, to save the dog? None of this even makes sense.</p>

<h4 class="pt-3">4. How would you do in my test?</h4>

<p>So morality is based solely on usefulness now? Cool.  How do you think you would do if I were allowed to design the test? You chose protection against mountain lions; I'd obviously make it related to things I'm good at, maybe density-functional theory and multivariable calculus. I'll also throw in a few other things I'm good at, driving a manual, etc. Yep, unless you possess the means to purchase a fast enough car and driving skills to turn a sub two-minute lap at Buttonwillow Raceway, you have no moral worth in my book.  I'm allowed to murder you and won't feel bad about it.  Note that those things are no less arbitrary that protection from a mountain lion.  You've been to Buttonwillow as much as I've encountered mountain lions.</p>

<p>Actually, maybe my skills test should simply be a one-item inventory: whether or not you can identify this as a silly argument.  If you propose an argument this mind numbing, you failed the test.</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Verdict</h2>
