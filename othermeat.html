<h1 class="pt-3">Claim: What about eating ants or jellyfish</h1>

<h2 class="pt-3">Details</h2>

<p>The carnist here either</p>

<ol>
<li>attempts in poor faith to find the edge of morality by inquiring about more obscure food sources</li>
<li>attmepts in (somewhat) good faith to find a substitute for meat that does less harm </li>
</ol>

<h2 class="pt-3">Problems With This Argument</h2>

<h4 class="pt-3">1. What is this argument?</h4>

<p>Are people are really so hell-bent on eating meat they'd rather eat something that's almost meat or tangentially meat than eat a vegetable? What even is this? </p>

<h4 class="pt-3">2. Probably all the sustainability/economic issues remain</h4>

<p>I don't know about what an all-insectivorous world looks like, but I assume that ants aren't necessarily any better at converting food into meat than cows (given their exoskeleton is largely chitin - which is indigestible to humans), certainly probably not an order of magnitude better.  So in that case, all of the sustainability issues would still exist, plus... why?  Same with jellyfish, but jellyfish don't have a nervous system and therefore are unable to suffer, so there's no moral argument there beyond conservation for wild jellyfish, but I assume medusa farms probably, again, run into the same sustainability issues. Also they don't have significant nutritional value to <a href="https://www.americanoceans.org/facts/what-do-jellyfish-eat/">each other</a> or <a href="https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/finfish-and-shellfish-products/7703/2">humans</a> so I would think the juice is just not worth the squeeze in this case. But if you are really hell bent on eating something, literally anything, as long as it was an animal, I'd pick something like farmed bivalves or jellyfish which don't suffer as a result</p>

<h2 class="pt-3">Verdict</h2>

<p>Just... why?</p>
